The reviews seemed to hit all marks for the perfect brunch to start our festival journey. <br/><br/>MY FELLOW YELPERS DID NOT STEER US WRONG!<br/><br/>1.) SERVICE- MICKEY was the best server i have encountered in a very long time. She knew what we needed before we even did. It was like we bought a $15,000 dollar bottle service table. She basically made us feel like she was apart of our crew and we were sad we had to leave her at the end.<br/><br/>2.) FOOD- Spectacular, cooked to perfection and met everyones specific tastes. The most notable item being the breakfast sandwich. What kind of flaky awesome bread was that!!<br/><br/>3.) ATMOSPHERE- Beautiful modern industrial feel, comfy booths and a bustling crowd but no wait for a table, perfect!<br/><br/>MICKEY WE MISS YOU AND CAN\\'T WAIT TO COME BACK!</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Perhaps the best thing here was the friendly and fast service from the bartenders. Maybe I chose the wrong beers and came just before some recent menu updates, because everything else was simply average. <br/><br/>Don\\'t get me wrong, the beers are all very drinkable, whether the Proud Mary kellerbier, Clothes-Off Pose-Off kolsch, Endless Love in the Dark porter, or Never Caught Juicin\\' IPA. Not necessarily knockout stuff, but still very pleasant nonetheless. <br/><br/>The food was also ambitious in incorporating global influences, like the pulled pork naan I tried, although it did end up being a bit watery and soggy. I understand they have refined their menu a bit so maybe things are firing on more cylinders now. In any case, this is a solid neighborhood venue.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">If you like beer and you are in San Francisco. \\xa0Hit up the Barrel House Brewhouse. \\xa0The staff was super nice and very attentive to our party. \\xa0They have a wide variety of beers choices to quench your palate. \\xa0My wife fell in love with the Strawberry &amp; Basil Almanac beer. \\xa0She swears it ranks in her top 3 favorite beers. \\xa0I went for a Rasputin Imperil Stout \"YUMMY!\"<br/><br/>The reason I gave this joint a 4 star is because their food menu was ok, with limited choices. \\xa0We weren\\'t very impressed with the food menu. \\xa0<br/><br/>In summary, if you like beer this is a 5 star joint. \\xa0If you want beer and food, you might end up being disappointed with their menu. \\xa0However, I can only speak for myself and the wife. \\xa0Perhaps, your palate will have a different conclusion. \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0<br/><br/>A big shout out to the awesome staff at this joint!</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">I came here for a friend\\'s birthday bash and had a fairly good time. We had the upstairs area all to ourselves, which was super nice. They have a good variety of drinks, as well as bites. The staff and atmosphere was chill, and I loved the long wooden communal tables.<br/><br/>However, when we had to vacate the upstairs area and move our celebration downstairs the staff and service was not as friendly and efficient. At one point, there was a misunderstanding and a staff member threatened to kick me out because he thought I was underaged... Slightly flattered, but also offended since I had been there for three to four hours. Sad to say, he killed my vibe.<br/><br/>Overall, a cool brewhouse to check out if you are in the area. However, I would not return by personal choice.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">I happen to run in to this place. Great warm atmosphere with a lively pulse that\\'ll make you make new friends. Beet Salad with arugula: yum!<br/>And a great IPA. I\\'m a tequila type of guy so take my beer review lightly. But not pilsner lightly;)<br/>Only thing is I wish the salad was bigger. I can eat like a pregnant waterbuffalo. But on another plus, this is the most smiles I\\'ve scene in one place in the city!! Loved it.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">I came here for dinner on a Saturday night, and we were able to get seated right away. After perusing the menu, I settled on the pretzel for my appetizer and the fish and chips for my main course. Everything was extremely salty, and we even let our server know. She did bring us a new batch of fries that were less salty. And the fish wasn\\'t consistent. One piece was cooked perfectly, but the other two pieces were over cooked and rubbery. There was also too much batter on the fish. I doubt I\\'ll be back because the food was lacking, but the ambience was great.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">This place was kind of forgettable. There was not anything special that stood out. Came here with some friends to try some beer. Got the flight which was only limited to 4 of their beers. The Fancy Guppa Summer Session IPA was easily my favorite among the four.<br/><br/>Place was pretty packed for a Saturday evening, particularly around the bar area and upstairs. Plenty of people yelling and cheering for who knows what reason.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Great beer selection with pricy snacks!<br/><br/>Street parking all around but come before 5 so as to not stress. If no, Muni stops right in front (5 Fulton).<br/><br/>The beer selection is crazy good and crazy large. \\xa0They serve 8 dollar flights for beer and have a spectacular mix of bitter, sweet and sour on the menu. \\xa0More importantly, they have a happy hour on weekdays and will certainly have rotating guest handles. Feel free to try a few before you buy a beer. \\xa0In addition, the menu had a custom manhattan selection if you like those types of mixers.<br/><br/>The food is typical of a selection in most pubs or bar eateries. \\xa0The food will definetely hold you off but for the price (~10-15), you might be better served to eat a little before or concentrate on alcohol. The atmosphere is wonderful. \\xa0Decently packed during 3 bay area sports teams played on the many televisions, but more than enough room to navigate around. <br/><br/>Come for a drink (or more) and a light snack! Rest assured you will have a fine night!</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">We came to Barrel Head as part of the Meet the Brewers Wednesday night tour thing, and this was the first stop on the Haight Line. It was absolutely packed, trying to find a place to post it while you have your beer was a challenge. But even though there was a large crowd, the bartender was quick with the drinks. <br/><br/>We didn\\'t eat here, so I can\\'t comment on the food. But it might be someplace I\\'ll check out if I\\'m ever in the area. <br/><br/>I ordered a barrel aged sour that I thought was very good! <br/><br/>The decor was very cute, with a ship/sea type of theme which gave it great character. Waitresses in passing weren\\'t very friendly, but the hostess was.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">OK food. Better for brews. Noisy atmosphere.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">This was one of the best breweries I\\'ve ever been to and I live in Colorado which is known for their microbreweries. I had a sour beer then one of their tequila cocktails and they were both wonderful. Our waitress was the sweetest and charged my sister\\'s phone for her. Definitely a cool spot, check it out if you\\'re in the area!</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">No complaints--all I can recall is a good night. <br/><br/>Went with a group of coworkers for happy hour several months ago, and it was packed. Luckily, we nabbed a table for all seven of us. I had a wonderful cocktail, despite this being a brewery, and the bites I stole from nearby appetizers were yummy. Great atmosphere, great for groups, great service. Would absolutely be back.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Visiting the city for the first time and I was determined to find craft beer in whatever shape, experience or venue possible. \\xa0Barrel Head delivered what was my favorite beer experience during this time.<br/><br/>I love the torpedo tap system and the generally creative aesthetic of the entire place. \\xa0The beer selection was nearly as eclectic as the interior itself. \\xa0I thoroughly enjoyed this venue and the location as well.<br/><br/>Not to be forgotten, the food selection was great. \\xa0From small bites to larger sandwiches, they aim to please all palettes.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Okay, we loved this spot. The entire vibe inside is so unique, hip, inviting, and just fun. Thanks to fellow Yelpers\\' reviews, we stopped here after a day of sightseeing the area on vacation and it definitely hit the spot. The Fancy Guppy IPA is wonderful, and we ordered the pretzel and a burger to share--it was the perfect amount of food to end the day with--wonderful service from our hostess, server, and food runners/bussers, great high-quality and fresh food, and just an overall great way to end the day. It\\'s a bit loud inside, but sometimes that\\'s just how you know everyone\\'s having an awesome time. That\\'s what I\\'d expect from a place like this. We went at dinner time on a Thursday and got right in.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">I left what I consider to be an honest review here after my first couple visits. At the time I felt like it was fully substaneated. I said I would wait a year, give it time to mature and then come back to check it. Over that time it has grown, the staff has turned over and the picked up a few clues. <br/><br/>When they first opened there was so much buzz the place was so crowded that you couldn\\'t get in. The overflow bled into neighboring restaurants and packed them as well. As I happened by today I got an opportunity to meet the current brewer who came from Devil\\'s Canyon Brewery. He blew my socks off with a white IPA. After tasting this beer for just a moment I have to say that they\\'re brewing is amazing. He also informed me that there\\'s a new chef and the menu has taken it up a notch for the better.<br/><br/>I\\'m sure this place will continue to change ocer the years, hopefully in a positive direction.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">4 Stars = the beer selection and happy hour menu. During happy hour you can get $2 off your house 16oz beer. \\xa0Some cost $5 so with the happy hour deal it can be $3 a glass. They have a variety of their own beers on tap to choose from as well. <br/><br/>3 Stars = the food selection was not appealing to me. Besides from some bar food, there weren\\'t ok many options. I feel like looking at some older pictures on yelp they had a wider selection. We did order their calamari and was happy with that, but decided to have dinner elsewhere after our beers.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Great place for casual dinner &amp; drinks with family or dressed up special events with friends! Love it</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Had a surprise birthday brunch here with some friends and had a great ole time! Obviously we started off with bottomless mimosas (at $18 with a purchase of an entree - pretty normal for SF); note that they didn\\'t leave any carafes for us at the table so unfortunately had to wait for them to top us off each time or flag them down. <br/><br/>We had poutine fries as an appetizer which were good but not the best I\\'ve ever had. In terms of entree, I had the fried chicken sandwich (which also came with a side of fries) that was pretty on point. The chicken had a bit more breading than I needed but it was still crispy and moist. Compared to the steak and eggs and brisket and hash, I was very happy with my choice over the other dishes. <br/><br/>Service was friendly and the restaurant is large (two floors).</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">The grilled cheese with a cup of tomato bisque is fantastic! I also loved all the cocktail choices. You know you\\'re at a great spot when the drink menu is larger than the food one. The environment is really cool and \"hip,\" if you will. Great for groups for dinner or just sitting at the bar to watch a game.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Well, let me just start with saying I hope our experience was an unusual one. Based on other reviews, I guess I just expected a little more. We made a yelp reservation, which totally wasn\\'t necessary because there were plenty of open tables. When we entered, there was nobody at the front. We stood and waited patiently, and a server walked by us twice. She made eye contact with us, and continued walking by. The third time she asked if we had been helped, I said I had reserved a table for two. She said to hang on a minute and walked somewhere around the bar. We continued to wait, and another guy came over and asked if we wanted a table for two. We were finally sat at a table after close to 5 minutes of standing at the front. Weird, but not a big deal. After a few minutes the same server who had walked by earlier greeted our table. We ordered drinks and they were delivered within a few minutes. We order the fish and chips and the pulled pork stuffed naan. The food was served hot, which was probably the best part about it. Fish and chips were good, nothing great. The fries were tasty, the fish was lacking much flavor in my opinion. Especially for the price. \\xa0My boyfriend liked the pulled pork stuffed naan well enough. He wasn\\'t crazy about the chickpea frites. Again, it was good, but he wouldn\\'t reorder it. After some time, we asked for our check and cashed out.<br/><br/>Overall, I was disappointed. The food wasn\\'t great, service was iffy and it just wasn\\'t a hugely positive experience for us! For the prices, I expected a little more. I\\'m hoping our experience was just a fluke, as it seems like most others have had more positive experiences. They had a great beer selection though, so maybe just come for the beer and skip the food! We most likely will not be returning any time soon!</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">I love this place! Went here after work on a Friday. \\xa0Wasn\\'t that busy...at first..They have a great selection of happy hour drinks and food. \\xa0It\\'s a really nice social gathering. \\xa0Ordered the sample of beers, which was very good. \\xa0Ordered Poutin fries, my favorite. \\xa0It can get really busy at night, but still worth going to.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">I love brewery restaurants like this that have nice menus. I came here with a group of people from St. Ignatius\\' young adult group. I hadn\\'t taken part in this group in a little over a year, but they posted on FB about free drinks and dinner at this place, so how could I pass? <br/><br/>I tried two appetizers--the ahi tartare and wings..and I chose the pulled pork stuffed naan for my main dish. It came with chickpea fries and I can\\'t say that I liked those because I didn\\'t finish them...and I am not a picky eater. I had a Coke with the meal. This restaurant has a nice atmosphere and is located on Fulton near Masonic. If you enjoy beer, I am sure it is a good choice.<br/><br/>Thanks Father Greg for treating the group.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Mickey you are awesome! Thank you for you delicious recommendations.<br/><br/>came here to bar hop and Mickey did a wonderful job helping us select beer samples. We loved it when you happily helped us changed tables because I wanted to sit at the fireplace and you were always sure to be quick to check on us, make sure our cups are filled with water and try to accommodate my requests the best you can. <br/><br/>I love the bruskies here. The food unfortunately not so much. Too \"innovative\" I might say. I can understand the idea behind them but the taste didn\\'t follow through. I also love the view and atmosphere of this place.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">We stuck with martinis tonight athough, I did make a point to try their house made KÖLSCH next time!<br/>After all--this is a brewhouse and what they make there looked fantastic.<br/>Barrel Head Brewhouse is a very comfortable place with great service and good food!<br/>The vibe was perfect --I was expecting to walk into frat-central but that wasn\\'t the case at all.<br/>It\\'s a pretty chill place.<br/>The chicken sandwich was beer brined and dabbed with bing cherry mustard. \\xa0We added white cheddar and bacon. It was excellent. The herbed fries that came with it were amazing too.<br/>This place is pretty easy to get to --it\\'s on the corner of Masonic/Fulton.<br/>Tonight was a heavy sports night with the Giants playing as well as a few college football games. \\xa0There were enough TV\\'s to keep everyone happy. \\xa0Go Giants!<br/>I\\'m \\xa0happy to have discovered another option for food and drink.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">What a great place. Cool bar is n one side. And great dining area on the other. \\xa0 Upstairs great quaint and trendy dining area upstairs. \\xa0 Food variety is amazing so are the drinks and the service. \\xa0Can wait to go back. Get the sampler. Has Tonga of meat. Huge portion to share between to larger guys. <br/>Convenient for parking and good location. We took my friends nephew it was good.</p>',\n",

       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Make a reservation if you plan to eat here! Unless you don\\'t mind waiting or sitting at the bar. Place is quite big but gets very crowded even on a Thursday night. Love the atmosphere of this place. Decor is very cutee. There\\'s a fireplace you can sit around. <br/><br/>Limited food selection but they have a huge selections of beer to choose from. If you sit at the tables by the bar you will not have a server. Order your food and drinks at the bar. Bartenders were quick. <br/><br/>Ordered buffalo and smoked Carolina mustard wings and poutine. Overpriced and not satisfied at all. Their wings were okay. Like another yelper said their poutine is just a plate of fries with sad piled on top. Try something else instead. <br/><br/>I would only recommend this place for their drinks. Come for happy hour!</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">After an impromptu volunteer shift at a friends restaurant serving and tending to tables, first time with no prior training might I add, we were feeling stressed still pumped from the whole experience so we decided to grab a drink.<br/><br/>Mules Gone Wild - Cucumber infused vodka, lime, ginger beer. \\xa0One of the best I\\'ve had <br/><br/>It was super packed on a Saturday. \\xa0We were able to grab seats at the bar where they were showing a football game on one TV and Boogie Nights on another where I got a glimpse of some huge titties. \\xa0Nothing like balls and breasts to end the night.<br/><br/>Nice interior, great service, good drink</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Came here today, a nice little Sunday afternoon amongst your typical bi-polar SF weather :)<br/><br/>We arrived with a small group a little before 4pm for some beer and grub and it wasn\\'t super busy. They were just finishing up their brunch hours so we ordered something from the brunch menu--overall, their menus brunch vs dinner are pretty much the same, minus the brunch one has the addition of eggs in their dishes while dinner has a couple more bar plate meals. The Fried Chicken Sandwich ($15) we had was quite impressive! Crispy, filling, with a perfect balance of coleslaw inside--the bread was toasted and a really nice crusty ciabatta--I was able to share half and feel pretty full. The fries were thick, crispy with some herbs that were also crispy (parsley maybe?)<br/><br/>On top of that, I had the Copper Fox Best Bitter Nitro ($6) and the Clothes off Pose off Kölshe ($6). Both were very tasty! I think I preferred the Kölshe a little more but the flavor profiles are quite different between the two so it just depends on what you prefer.<br/><br/>I really liked the location--tons of spaces to sit, around the bar, some high tops and low tables. They also have a huge second floor! The atmosphere was super chill with some cool art along the walls (think Giant octopus!) and some brewing vats and whatnot. Highly recommend, this place was a great little hangout spot!</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Simple disappointment. Thought it was going to be a brewery but instead turned out to be a family friendly, LOUD, packed restaurant that had scant beer on the menu. Yes, the menu had oat sodas from other producers but Barrel head just had a few of its own, nothing that jumped out as intriguing.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">We hosted our engagement party here this past Saturday. From booking it with Natasha to the day of the event, they made it so amazing and seem less. Our servers were extremely attentive and gave us amazing service! I\\'m so thankful we did it here and will do more events here, moving forward. Great venue with even better staff. Thank you for making it amazing for us on this special day!</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">I came here for a friend\\'s birthday and we reserved one long table on the 2nd floor. This is a great location for a birthday because it was super roomy upstairs and not too loud. At one point, there was over 20 people and the table was plenty large enough to fit everyone with a mixture of standing and sitting at the table. <br/><br/>I ordered the barrel beef burger and had it served medium even though the menu specifies med-rare. Burger came with a side of fries that was pretty filling.</p>',\n",

The Hoffensive coordinator hellerbock has wonderul floral/citrus notes Thankfully, they have a nice selection of fun cocktails and who can resist not ordering Hookers &amp; Blow?! (get your mind outta the gutter!) It has Hookers House white corn whiskey, sugar, orange and topped off with Barrel Head kolsch. Or you can do what I did and built my own manhattan: Hookers House white corn whiskey, dolin blanc, bitters and a luxardo cherry. TOTAL YUM.

They have the typical stuff like wings which we got and smoke salmon toast.

       "  '<p lang=\"en\">A girlfriend of mine came across a 7×7 article on \"Where to Sip Bottomless Mimosas in San Francisco\". Looking through the list, we both realized the only restaurant we hadn\\'t gone to was Barrelhead Brewhouse. We decided to have brunch on Saturday, May 28th at 12 noon. I easily made a reservation for four through Yelp SeatMe.<br/><br/>*Hog Island sweetwater oysters ($18 for Half Dozen): Radish, mignonette, pickled serrano, lemon<br/>*Breakfast sandwich ($13): Bacon, 2 eggs, American cheese, hollandaise, with herbed fries<br/>*Fried chicken sandwich ($14): Chicken thighs coated with a BHB beer batter, coleslaw, on a ciabatta bun, with herbed fries - spicy upon request<br/>*Brisket hash ($15): Smoked brisket, onions, yukon gold potatoes, sunny side up egg, hollandaise<br/>*Steak and eggs ($17): Bavette steak, salsa verde, 2 eggs your way, yukon gold potatoes, arugula<br/>*Polenta bowl ($10): Parmesan cheese, shishito chillies toast, sunny side up egg, BHB bloody mary reduction<br/>*Bottomless mimosa ($18 with purchase of an entree): sparkling wine, orange juice x3<br/>*Mimosa ($9)<br/><br/>We all ended up sharing everything. My favs were the oysters, the fried chicken sandwich and the steak and eggs. The oysters were light and silky. I enjoyed the mignonette. I love fried chicken, so I adored the sandwich. I did forget to ask for it spicy, but it was still good. Crispy on the outside and moist inside. The steak and eggs were beautifully plated and the steak was nice and tender. Our server kept the bottomless mimosas going, although I did have to ask her several times for water. I think she was the only server on the floor, so very understandable. She had a lot of tables to tend to.<br/><br/>Very fun place for a bottomless brunch. I walked away very buzzed, so I guess you could say, mission accomplished!</p>',\n",

Unfortunately it\\'s a little loud and hectic feeling inside, but once you have a drink down, all that starts to matter less ...<br/><br/>I\\'ve eaten here a few times and always liked the food. The poutine was yummy and comforting, the pretzel is tasty (albeit a bit small), the risotto is fantastic, the fried green sandwich got rave reviews from my friends ... But my absolute all-star meal here is the ahi tartare app (I just turn it into a meal by keeping it to myself!). The one thing I haven\\'t loved are the salads; I would steer clear of those. They\\'re fine, but why waste your time when there are so many better choices?!<br/><br/>The beer: just yes. I love the long list of taps and bottles, and ALWAYS find something I want to drink. I\\'ve recently dabbled in the cocktails (also good), but beer is the best answer here. After all, it is a brew house.<br/><br/>One last thing I love - it doesn\\'t seem like too many folks have discovered this hidden gem yet. Or perhaps they\\'re too lazy to visit.

Not particularly interesting. \\xa0. \\xa0Also, They were mostly German style beers - which just isn\\'t the style I\\'m really into - why is everyone so into German style right now? <br/><br/>The rest of the review is going to sound like 4 stars. \\xa0<br/><br/>$2 of house pints for happy hour from 4-6 pm<br/><br/>They also have a a bunch of guest taps - so that\\'s a serious plus.<br/><br/>We got the Poutine, Buffalo Wings and Tuna. \\xa0All were tasty. \\xa0I\\'d say the Poutine was best - lots of gravy and cheese! Tuna was also good, game with wonton crackers and on top of guacamole. \\xa0The wings tasted like wings. \\xa0They could have been crispier. <br/><br/>They have lots of TVs - so good for sports (go dubs!).<br/><br/>Pretty decent sized space.

You walk in to a sighting of luxurious seating, a full bar, and lights hung across the entire restaurant. Seems pretty nice, huh? <br/><br/>What really brought down the rating was the food quality and value. I was not impressed by the fish and chips nor was the burger any better. The fried fish\\'s batter wasn\\'t well seasoned. In addition, the coleslaw was just a bunch of chopped cabbage with no flavor whatsoever. I had to doctor it up by asking for a ring of onion from my counterpart who ordered a burger. Oh, and his burger? Yeah, just a plain old burger.

The pulled pork stuffed naan came second to the oysters- the pork was very moist and full of bbq flavor. The chickpea fries were not my cup of tea- if tasted like fried tofu sticks that were slightly bit dry.<br/>Drinks: Ordered Mistress of my Mistress, Mules Gone Wild, Naughty By Nature, and the Panhandle Sangria. My preference went in the order of Naughty by Nature, Mules Gone Wild, Panhandle Sangria, and then Mistress of my Mistress.

They have two floors, big wood tables, good for big parties and super quick service. We were sat upstairs which felt like an oversized balcony overlooking the restaurant down below. Super hip and young vibe so the energy was up! <br/><br/>For dinner, I got the skin on Atlantic Salmon for $24. Seared salmon, buttermilk mashed potatoes, brocoli rabe, roasted tomatoes and smoked salmon buerre. The dish was vibrant and colorful! The salmon was situated in the middle and everything seemed to be placed around it like a nest. The flavors were great as well. For my cocktail, I got the Daniel\\'s Mistress for $11 which was their whiskey rye cocktail. Lots of mint and super fresh flavor!<br/><br/>This place was awesome. I\\'ll definitely be back to try other things on the menu as their appetizer menu looks super delicious!</p>',\n",

A nice size bar as well as high tops, booths and plenty of standing room. \\xa0We got here around 3 on a Sunday so it was not too busy and we were able to catch some seats at the bar. The bartender immediately greeted us and grabbed our beers. We both went for the house IPA. Very enjoyable. For the second round I got the bloody mary and my bf got the house kolsch. The bloody mary was deeeeeeelicious. Spicy, tons of flavor and in a pint glass (I hate those small high ball bloody marys, they go down too quick!) We grabbed some cooked up shishito chilies that were the seasoned with just the right amount of salt and piping hot. <br/>The only compliant is there prices here, I thought they were a bit steep compared to other bars in the area. Perhaps next time I\\'ll come for the \"hoppy hour\" (Monday - Friday 4-6) which includes $2 off all house drafts, brew tails, and house cocktails.</p>',\n",

My suggestion is to get the strange brew - it\\'s a must! <br/><br/>My a-ok rating is based on the food here. I want it to be so much better than it is, but it kind of disappoints. The chicharrones are okay, but a bit overpriced. The pretzel is delicious but pretty standard; the wings are delicious but you can pretty much get those at any bar. I would not recommend the fish and chips at all. Too much cabbage and the batter is just odd.

It\\'s not what I would call a typical bar, in that it\\'s sort of an eatery with a wide selection of brews including many made right on site. I loved their kolsch and their red but any of the others were great too. The brews crafted there were not exotic fruit beers, but staples of most popular ale styles done right. (And if you\\'re there at the right time, you can catch the brewmaster working on them, which fills the entire place with the magical smell of hops). <br/><br/>The food is excellent-not your typical bar grub(which I also love), but real well prepared, more upscale type food at very reasonable prices that they could probably get away with charging more for. They also have poutine. Mmm, poutine.<br/><br/>Again, having worked with the bar my take on the service is hard to gauge and not typical. But the first time I stopped by before officially working with them to scope the place out they were quick, attentive and friendly. <br/><br/>Also, the ambiance. I know this is a matter of personal preference, but for me-I love it. There\\'s a slight nautical theme(the taps are all welded into a torpedo and, well-you\\'ll see), but it\\'s not overbearing and kitschy. It\\'s the right amount of lighting, always excellent music and whatever\\'s playing on the TVs above the bar don\\'t drown out the seating at other parts of the place.<br/><br/>If I lived closer, I would go out of my way to make this a regular after work or gametime spot.</p>',\n",

While scouring yelp, I come across barrel head and I\\'m immediately intrigued. I love breweries: \\xa0The industrial feel &amp; look, the creative spin on bar foods and duh.... The house made beer. How can you lose!? To add to its overall flare, barrel head also offered bottomless mimosas. SOLD.<br/><br/>Barrel Head is in a very unassuming part of NoPa, nestled between our beloved papalote and our coffee nemesis, Starbucks. Walking by, you wouldn\\'t think much of the place but once you\\'re in, you can\\'t help but admire its size (that\\'s what she said?). The interior is two levels, open floor plan, has a very rustic/woodsy feel and, of course, equipped with beer tanks. We were seated upstairs with views of the whole restaurant.... and TV\\'s at every turn (great for game days).<br/><br/>We started our order with, of course and true to brunch tradition, coffee and bottomless mimosas. <br/>Food wise we shared the following:<br/><br/>P.B.L.T- pork belly lettuce tomato. While I typically sing pork belly praises from the roof tops, I was low key unimpressed. The sandwich was LARGE, stacked with lettuce, tomato and over-salted-kinda-dry pork belly. Maybe im spoiled with Asian restaurants serving beautifully marinated and tender pork belly, maybe. Its hard to fault barrel head for my palate being so picky, but I wouldn\\'t order it again. The sandwich was also served with fries, which were standard at best.<br/><br/>The saving grace (minus the mimosas) was *drum roll*<br/><br/>Bacon poutine fries<br/>The outer paleo health freak in me was disgusted while the inner-fat kid grinned from ear to ear. Think: a skillet with fries covered in poutine, cheese and bacon. We weren\\'t hungover at the time, but it would have been heaven on earth should we have been. It was rich, it was hearty and it was just downright unhealthy..... dare I say more?<br/><br/>The service was friendly and the mimosas were filled quickly. Overall, a great date spot or somewhere to watch a game while trying out great beers. Food wise, I\\'d recommend communal family style dishes. Four stars well deserved with a potential future bump to 5 when im able to come back and try the beers.</p>',\n",

I understand that the bar is close to a college campus and there might be students trying to swing a fake ID, but I was caught off guard and embarrassed (not to mention uncomfortable shouting my parents\\' home address over the shoulders of strangers at a bar).

I only had drinks - the sangria was a little sweet because it was made with madeira and was white sangria instead of the traditional red sangria with brandy and red wine. <br/>Have the upstairs looking down on the rest of the place was nice and made it feel open and airy. The only thing is it was a bit loud - they need to put felt under the tables or something because there is not much to absorb the sound.</p>',\n",

Single bulb lights were strung around creating a dimly lit romantic ambiance. Service was friendly and laid back. Do recommend the Poutine gravy fries here, they were pretty tasty!!<br/><br/>Beers.... were just okay to me. We had a few of their in-house draft IPA\\'s and a Porter.

       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Barrel Head. Is. Awesome. <br/><br/>When I saw it opened across from my neighborhood Lucky store, I immediately investigated. New brewery? Yes, please. Takes brunch reservations? Oh yeah. Brews their own beer but also serves cocktails and features other fantastic guest beers? Don\\'t stop. My enthusiasm abounds. <br/><br/>Yesterday we stopped by for brunch. We had been twice before for drinks, and had received such good service, I would call it notable. The first time, our bartender described the menu to us and made recommendations, and we didn\\'t even ask! Also, we tried their house-brewed beer and it was frakking awesome. The second time, we came on a Thursday night, and it was super busy (I believe they had a deejay), so we sat upstairs. We were skeptical that someone was going to take our order, but we were pleasantly surprised when we were served right away by a very pleasant and attentive young lady. I think perhaps dining out so much in San Francisco, where you often wait 20-30 minutes for a cocktail, can leave you feeling pretty jaded. <br/><br/>Anyhow-let\\'s talk brunch. Far and away, the best brunch I\\'ve had in AGES (and I go to brunch A LOT). We started with an order of 5 chicken wings with blue cheese (gratuitous, I know). Our wings were served promptly and they brought us 6 instead of 5 wings--I don\\'t know if that was intentional, but it was a nice touch. That blue cheese dressing is delicious! I would like a gallon of that for the house. I ordered the brisket hash and the boyfriend ordered the \\xa0breakfast sandwich with sausage. Both were fucking awesome. The brisket in my hash was melt in your mouth tender, and the bernaise sauce was a wonderful idea--I want bernaise on everything. My boyfriend\\'s sandwich was off the hook - the sausage was delicious and the bun was amazing - like if a croissant and bagel got married and had a delicious brioche baby. Skip the American cheese and opt for cheddar or Swiss. <br/><br/>Our cocktails also rocked. My boyfriend\\'s Bloody Mary was hands down the best I\\'ve had. He remarked that it was the first time he didn\\'t have to ask for extra horseradish. But we want them to bring back the one with the prosciutto!! My drink was called \"ginger ginger\" something or other, and it\\'s my favorite cocktail on BH\\'s menu. The mimosas were also good (we had orange and grapefruit)-- loved the glassware. <br/><br/>The service is tops: fast, friendly and attentive. <br/><br/>Yes, yes, yes!</p>',\n",

Poutine, ahi tartare, chicharrones, to name a few. <br/><br/>Their selection of brews are good as well. Definitely order one of those to try. Then start going for their shots, shots, shots! The shots I ordered came in lil boot shot cups. Cute.<br/><br/>One small complaint I have is my party\\'s bill came out to be around $500 with gratuity added already. However, i understand the tax on food and drinks but they taxed the gratuity portion as well. :/ I just think that isn\\'t right. Overall, I like this place.</p>',\n",

Dangerous indeed!<br/><br/>We ordered the following plates to share:<br/>Shishito Chiles - really good and not very many spicy ones in the bunch.<br/>Poutine - it was good, but would probably pass next time.<br/>Ahi Tartare - very delicious<br/>Mixed Baby Greens - this had pomegranate, persimmon, and grilled pear. I probably could eat a bowl of this stuff.<br/>Risotto - this was a vegetarian risotto, but added spanish chorizo. I actually didn\\'t care for this one. It felt like it was missing something and didn\\'t necessarily seem to have the consistency of a risotto.<br/><br/>The shishito chiles, ahi tartare, and the mixed baby greens were the highlights. <br/><br/>This is a cool spot to hangout for some drinks, food and to watch some sports.</p>',\n",

I couldn\\'t here anything that was being said on just the other side of the table. Maybe it was because it was playoff baseball? But it was pretty unbearable, definitely brought down the experience a bit for me. It also gets warm up there, so that wasn\\'t cool either. If I come back, I\\'m definitely requesting seating on the first level.<br/><br/>All in all, good beers, pricey eats, LOUD AS FUUUU up stairs. Not bad, but not amazing either.</p>',\n",

It\\'s comfort food but I rather have the poutine over the hash. The hash just taste like mush fries<br/><br/>Dinner:<br/>1. French onion soup= probably one of the best I had anywhere else<br/>2.

The music was way too loud for a Sunday morning - but they did turn it down when I asked. And our server was just \"meh\" kinda just zero enthusiasm for the job...<br/><br/>I did really enjoy the hash, but they should serve it with toast, same for the mushroom omelet. The breakfast sandwich (I did not try it) came on a way too big and bready english muffin- (live a Wolfermann\\'s) and that is great as an English muffin with butter and jam, but too big for a breakfast sammy. She also said the sausage in the sammy had an odd flavor..again I did not try it.<br/><br/>The Yelp reviews say dinner is great - so I might try that. <br/><br/>If I had a bunch of friends in town and they wanted to go to brunch I would think of this place because there was no wait AND they could accommodate a crowd.<br/><br/>$64 with tip for 3 people, (including 1 cocktail)</p>',\n",

We decided on the beer royals per the bartenders &amp; customers suggestion. Its basically a beer cocktail. Really good (I\\'m so a cocktail kinda person). Shortly after the bday girl arrives and the bartender made her a very strong drink (per the bday girls request), found out it was her bday and gave it to her on the house.

We ordered 25 pieces of chicken wings and the avocado toast for appetizers while we waited for the rest of our group.

The main draw for me was that Barrel Head is a microbrewery and they serve their own original beers, with some pretty interesting descriptions. The food itself is good quality American gastropub fare. <br/><br/>- BBQ Sampler - brisket, pulled pork, chicken sausage, pork sausage, pickles, chicharones. Brisket was probably the best, being super tender and fall-apart smooth, smothered in a sweet &amp; smoky sauce. The serving of pulled pork was generous, and seemed to be marinated in the same sweet-smoky sauce of the brisket, without being overly saucy. Both sausages were delicious, had a slight char, and had a satisfying snap, while both being distinctly unique. Chicharones were a unique side. Pickles were a bit salty.<br/>- Green salad with olive oil, grilled pear persimmons, pomegranate. Not on their menu online, and a nice contrast to the meaty BBQ sampler. <br/><br/>Beers:<br/>- Pumpkin Peach IPA (special seasonal release) - delicious! Tastes exactly like what it says. Very interesting and full of layers of flavor. <br/>- Pine Meat Fresh Hop Pale Ale - piney, hoppy deliciousness, but not too mouth drying.<br/><br/>Service was super friendly and sweet, although they seemed to disappear after sometime. Too bad, otherwise we would have ordered more beer.<br/><br/>Overall, we had a great time. I\\'d recommend Barrel Head for anyone looking for beers and barbecue.</p>',\n",

And, he\\'s on the shy side of 30! <br/><br/>Seriously, there are so many things that he transforms into culinary delights. My favorites are the Ahi and Hog Island oyster appetizers, though others swear by the authenticity of his Poutine. His Fish &amp; Chips never miss, but my current favorite among the main courses is the grilled pork chop with cabbage and black lentils. (Normally, I avoid lentils, but these are amazing!)<br/><br/>As good as the food is, as adventurous and pleasing as the house brews are, the real reason to make BHB a regular stop is that the staff will make you feel at home. There are many things that I will miss about living in San Francisco, but none more than the people behind this NOPA gem. Seriously!

You need to leave this area.\" No smile, no apology, no explanation. \\xa0She wouldn\\'t even let us use the upstairs restroom.<br/><br/>So our group hung out downstairs, where it was insufferably crowded and there was a 20-minute wait to use the downstairs bathroom. \\xa0At 9:15pm, our group again attempted to go upstairs for our event. \\xa0The same woman came bounding down the stairs, yelling at us: \"WE\\'RE NOT READY FOR YOU YET!\" with the most horrible bitch look on her face. No \"I\\'m sorry\" or \"it\\'ll be x minutes\" - no courtesy of any kind - just screaming at us to go away.<br/><br/>Several members of our group, including my husband and I, were so rattled by her rudeness that we left. (My husband is a home brewer and was really looking forward to trying the beer.)<br/><br/>I later found out, from those in our group who stayed and waited, that this woman is the bar\\'s other manager (whoa!), that our group was not let upstairs until 9:40pm, and that she was nasty to our group the rest of the night, to the point where people are still talking about it the next day.<br/><br/>Our running group will not plan an event at Barrel Head again.

But, here\\'s the thing: while the food was not stellar, the drinks were enjoyable (and they have this fun make-your-own-Manhattan option), the menu was hilarious, the space was neat, the employees were fantastic (nice, friendly, and accommodating), and we all pretty much had a blast. Good enough for me!<br/><br/>***Accessibility Info***<br/><br/>Venue - I didn\\'t get a good look at the rest of the venue, but I do seem to recall an upstairs section. There\\'s a combination of bar, bar top, regular top, and booth seating, all just in the section by the front door, so accessibility isn\\'t a real issue.<br/><br/>Bathroom - Accessible, though the bags of malt that they have laying around as decoration may require just a little maneuvering around.</p>',\n",

Total people-pleasing grub, and not in a \"just give me any food\" kind of way.....really tasty stuff!<br/><br/>We ordered multiple dishes for happy hour bites to share:<br/><br/>-pretzel (what the heck makes these so addictive!?) - jeez, I think we got 3 or 4 of them<br/>-shishito chiles - YUM - perfectly spiked with course salt and pepper or chiles<br/>-poutine w/ cheese curds &amp; gravy - delicious. would probably ask for well done fries next time, but, still......great, warm indulgence<br/>-ahi tartar - fresh, but could have been a bit more interesting or spicy....maybe just lacked a distinctive herb like dill or cilantro<br/>-oysters - nice with the chili for a kick (mignonette could have been a bit better balanced - very stark tasting, if that makes sense)<br/>-smoked wings - good (get \\'em well done)<br/>-fish &amp; chips - above average for what it is! tasty &amp; crispy, not greasy. and who doesn\\'t want MORE fries....<br/>-Beet salad (no opinion on this, I never got to it)<br/><br/>Beer selection.....plenty of variety to go around! Clever-ish/catchy names that just make you want to read the whole beer menu, even if you are looking for wine! <br/><br/>I had the Kolsch (Clothes Off Pose Off Kolsch), which was super-enjoyable!<br/>Also had a little taste of my friend\\'s beer towards the end of the evening - BeSureToDrinkYourOvaltine Mocha Porter. Mmmmm!<br/><br/>Service: quick &amp; courteous. Nothing over the top or too interjecting -- just right for a larger party like ours.<br/><br/>The bro-dude factor increased exponentially as the night went on.

They have a version of kolsch that was quite tasty, the oyster stout was yum, and they even have some dessert-like beers that are definitely a good replacement for dessert since they only had a brownie as their dessert option that night.<br/><br/>The food was ok. The gravy and cheese on the poutine was good, but I like my fries thinner. The brussel sprout salad was surprisingly a good combo of nuts, bacon, and cream. Those were the best ones out of everything else I tried. <br/><br/>I\\'d definitely come back for the beer and at happy hour time as it\\'s $2 off beer and brewtails.

It was overcooked (see my previous rants on burgers being overcooked after people ask how you want them). The \"herb\" fries were barely sprinkled with parsley flakes, which is honestly, just a colorful garnish. All of this for $17.<br/><br/>I had a craft beer. It was ok. I\\'ll note that the bartender was a bit spazzy and unenthusiastic about helping me find a beer to my liking.

As for the drinks, I had two Hookers and Recreation and some rum and cokes. So good! I saw my friends ordering some little boot shot glasses of Jameson and that made me giggle. I don\\'t know if that\\'s something specific to Barrel Head, but it was cute none the less. :)<br/><br/>The waitress for that night rocked! I wish I had gotten her name, but anyways, she was great. :) <br/><br/>I enjoyed myself so much here, I brought someone else with me the next day to try out their brunch! We both had the brisket hash and another helping of that heavenly poutine. The hash was delicious. Those orders with two coffees ended up being close to $60 if I recall correctly. <br/><br/>I would probably come here more often if it was a little cheaper, but with this being SF, it\\'s to be expected.

This is the worst service I have ever had and I will never come here again. Don\\'t bother wasting your time here - it will make you extremely unhappy.

The burger is really great. They serve it with heirloom tomatoes and Cowgirl Creamery Cheese. I had mine medium-rare and it was perfectly cooked. They also brought me some extra aioli (just ask for it) which I used for my fries. It was pretty great.<br/><br/>What I also really love is their \"Manhattan Project\" menu which allows you to choose the ingredients to your manhattan-style drink. There are 4 ingredients and 4 choices for each so that\\'s a lot of drinks that you\\'re going to have to work your way through in order to find your perfect combination. Chris, one of the bartenders is pretty fantastic in explaining each ingredient to you so you can make your best educated decision. <br/><br/>The bar also houses a fantastic tap, shaped like a torpedo. It\\'s pretty awesome. And of course, it houses a pretty good list of on-tap beers. There\\'s something for every taste.<br/><br/>They just opened and so have a few kinks to work out. But I have to say, I\\'ve been to a few restaurants/bars in their early days and these guys already have it pretty together. I will, no doubt, become a regular here. <br/><br/>Excited to have these guys in the neighborhood!</p>',\n",

Generally, you do have positive reviews, but those few that aren\\'t, you should realize they do have some validity to it. <br/> My first review was quite negative and with merit. There was a family who witnessed the entire incident which happened to have young children present. Bad behavior and foul language isn\\'t acceptable and quite unnecessary at any time. The employee in question does work at your establishment and yes the employees come out on their breaks, etc to smoke out front of the establishment. <br/> Food here and the beer prices are a bit high at this establishment. They\\'re really catering to the college crowd and the food here is hit and miss. Some days the service is good and other times it\\'s horrible. It\\'s popular due to the beer selection but it\\'s only certain types. Not much choices of a variety of red beers?</p>',\n",

It wasn\\'t terribly loud inside, so my group could still hear each other, but then again it wasn\\'t a full house, so that may be something to consider.

And, in his own words \"basically calling us faggots\". \\xa0As a restaurant in SF, you should know much better to use homophobic slurs in mixed company, especially when you\\'re serving a gay man (me) and his boyfriend. <br/><br/>I don\\'t care how good some of your beers are, but I\\'ll never step foot in your establishment again or recommend it to anyone I know. Good luck and again watch your words.</p>',\n",

Although I think anything with their home made mustard would be delightful. <br/><br/>Also, they Steve actual 16 oz pints. Worth an extra star right there.</p>',\n",

I tried the sampler brews since im not a big beer drinker anymore, and lagers have always been my favorite but I was feeling kinda when in Rome. . <br/>I enjoyed 2 out of 4. And we all shared the BBq entree as a sampler appetizer. It all was pretty good. Service was good not great and her energy was low but not bad in anyway. And my cuzin loved the unusual pickles.

       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Finally came here for the first time after hearing lots about it! We have some friends who live just 2 blocks from here, and they were totally psyched when a new restaurant opened in their \\'hood. So I\\'ve been hearing about the \"new brewpub\" for many months now. <br/><br/>I like the vibe. It\\'s a pretty big space on the SF restaurant scale (so many places are just so tiny) and we walked right in and got a table on a Friday night. Love that! If you read any of my other reviews, you may know I\\'m extremely anti-waiting. I just don\\'t buy into the \"it\\'s worth a wait\" psychology.<br/><br/>The had a special pre-fixe Oktoberfest menu going on, which looked fun, but none of us ended up ordering it. It was 3 courses and each course came with a beer pairing. Fun idea but knowing myself I can\\'t justify the $40 since I wouldn\\'t be able to eat/drink it all! I ordered the risotto instead. Nothing spectacular but tasty enough. I also ordered a glass of their special hand-pressed cider. It was decent (I\\'ve had better, but still tasty). They also have happy hour discounts on beer and cocktails until 7, so we were just able to take advantage of that!<br/><br/>We sat at a booth which was nice. I also like that it was noisy enough to feel \"hopping\" but not so noisy you had to shout at your booth-mates to be heard. There were some strange painted portraits on the wall that didn\\'t really seem to fit the rest of the decor (see photo) but hey, you gotta know that everyone is trying to be quirky/original in this city!<br/><br/>I\\'ll probably be back here at some point.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Holy crap every time we go here it gets better and better. This is an excellent example of a new business that listens to its clients and continues to grow.<br/><br/>The menus have had at least 3 different incarnations in as many months and the number of food offerings have doubled. Food we have tried:<br/>o Burger - \"this may be my favorite burger in the entire city\" said my boyfriend<br/>o Whitefish - buttery flavor without feeling too oily<br/>o \"Cheese Fondue Soup Sort of Thing\" - that\\'s the real name. And it is f-ing delicious.<br/>o Brunch - see previous update<br/>o Pork Cubano Sandwich - a touch spicy and on excellent toasted bread. I love when bread isn\\'t so crunchy that it cuts up your mouth and this is perfect. <br/>o Fries - again, it needs repeating, but they are the perfect balance of crispy and chewy!<br/><br/>Best part: THE HOUSE BREWS ARE FINALLY HERE! Last night we tried the Saison and the Hawaiian IPA. The Saison was metallic and sweet; easy drinking. The IPA smelled like mango and fresh cut grass, and tasted amazing. It definitely had a hoppy bitterness to it as an IPA should, but if you are new to IPAs, this is a good one to start with, not too sharp, and easy to drink as far as IPAs go. Delicious both of them.<br/><br/>They also play good music, spanning back to the late 70s to the present. Service is also pretty excellent and very friendly, although understandably at peak times there may be lulls between server check-ins, but they are generally easy to flag over if needed.<br/><br/>So impressed and so proud of them for the continued updates and delicious brews. Can\\'t wait to go back!</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">I am amazed to see a new spot open in San Francisco and immediately be one of my favorite spots in town! I am a big beer fan (and snob) and the list of beer on draft will not disappoint even the most serious beer connoisseur! One of my faves,deschutes is represented quite well, and there are beers on draft that are local and regional as well as other staples from around the world. 4 nitro beers on tap! <br/><br/>all of the taps come up to the bar in a vintage; really cool looking torpedo which looks like it was taken from a sub in the 1940\\'s. The decor is top notch, with classy booths surrounded by tables, fireplace, and of course beer fermenting tanks.<br/><br/>The food is great!!! Don\\'t come to barrel head expecting white table cloths and butler style service. That\\'s not the vibe or what they\\'re going for here. It\\'s good old American food which goes perfectly with their beer.<br/>The monte Cristos are awesome little bites of decadence- something different but really delicious.<br/>The fries are great and come with home made mustard that is to die for!<br/>The vegetarian sandwich is almost like a veggie burger but is made with a pAtty from the awesome folks at hodo soy, sooooo good! I love their burger - one time it came slightly under cooked but they fixed it in a jiff! The new burger came within 5 min or less.<br/>The ribs are probably my favorite thing on the menu. Falls right off the bone. And I\\'m a huge huge fan of the Cubano sandwich- hands down my favorite thing on the menu and comes with a salad which has pickled peppers and onions. Soooo delicious!<br/><br/>I have been running beer tours on airbnb and made this my final stop on the tour because of the awesome extensive beer list, their amazing staff, and great food. Thanks for all of the great times; looking forward to many more. Big shout out to Ivan, CJ, Lauren, Jay, and Natasha for hosting us on these tours! The staff here is super nice and accommodating! Thank you barrel head for keeping NOPA awesome and for keeping my beer tours even awesomer!!!<br/><br/>I</p>',\n",

My go-to is Deschutes Fresh Squeezed IPA. \\xa0<br/><br/>Additionally there is a full bar with some deee-lish cocktails. \\xa0If you like gin - the strange brew will immediately become your favorite cocktail....in the world. \\xa0Just don\\'t have more than two, as you may not remember the third. \\xa0:)<br/><br/>The menu is always changing, but it is always really good. \\xa0If you want greasy, go with the poutine. \\xa0(Soooo good). \\xa0Their wings are solid, but in a healthy way. \\xa0I think the hamburger is the only thing that hasn\\'t changed on the menu, and it is for a good reason. \\xa0AMAZING! \\xa0If you are looking for a grubby Saturday or Sunday brunch - this is definitely your spot.t<br/><br/>The place itself has such a cool vibe. It\\'s big enough that if you want to go for sports the bar caters to that vibe, but if you want a night out with friends or looking for chill/cool first date spot it\\'s great as well.<br/><br/>Finally, the people that work there are just plain rad. \\xa0Take a moment to have a conversation with one of them, and you\\'ll feel like you\\'ve been friends for awhile.</p>',\n",

I tried the flight of their house beer which was pretty good. The best part was the selection. When I hit a bar I always like to try something on the tap I\\'ve never seen or tried before and this place is perfect for that. They have a great selection of \"guest beers\" from all over.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">An absolutely crucial addition to the neighborhood! This place has it all: beautifully designed interior with impeccable attention to detail, outstanding food, TVs for those Warriors, 49ers, A\\'s and Giants games, and a ton of beer. <br/><br/>I\\'ve eaten there 4 times now, so lemme run down the menu:<br/><br/>The GREATS: brunch menu is ALL THAT - mini Monte Cristos, Loco Moco, Green Eggs &amp; Ham, and the FANTASTIC Croque Senor, a Cuban twist on a Croque Monsieur with house made pickles. Despite the fact that they\\'ve only been open a month, they\\'ve already got that good Sunday Funday, fun brunch vibe goin, and the menu is one of the better brunch menus I have seen in recent memory.<br/><br/>Also under the GREAT column are the ribs. Their dinner menu is on the carnivorous side, so it\\'s not surprising that their meat dishes are the ones that stand out. The ribs were rich with interesting spice. <br/><br/>GREAT: Their hours! We don\\'t have a lot of places open till 2 (especially that serve food) on this side of town and it\\'s about time! Hope it starts a trend.<br/><br/>Lastly, the burger is really damn good. They make the bun almost like a piece of garlic bread, and it is everything you could want in a burger.<br/><br/>I really like that they serve many of the dishes with a pretty serious side salad, with pecans and dried cranberries. So many times, a side salad is just a pile of leaves but not at Barrel Head. <br/><br/>My biggest complaint - and it seems like one that has been echoed in other reviews - is that they don\\'t have a ton of healthy, non-meat options. I would like to see a couple big salads, a chicken dish, and some tastier vegetarian options. I had the tofu burger, and it was lackluster and strange. I would also like to see a better Happy Hour.<br/><br/>All in all, it\\'s a fantastic restaurant and I think their dinner menu is experiencing the normal growing pains of a new restaurant but I look forward to seeing where things go.</p>',\n",

What else can you expect from San Francisco? It\\'s also right next to a college, and we were able to find free parking within a block\\'s walk. <br/><br/>I got the stuffed naan, delicious in their own right, but the real stars of the plate were the chickpea fries. It\\'s like polenta fries except my body didn\\'t express any regrets afterward. I would order the same thing again just for the deep fried love rectangles. This is an understatement: fantastic food. <br/><br/>Also they have got some fancy drinks here. I had my first negroni here and I hope it won\\'t be the last.</p>',\n",

They have an great beer list, both on tap and in bottles, and we were brought samples of the bartender\\'s current favorite while we waited for our food. <br/><br/>To eat, I got the prosciutto hash with sunny side up eggs. The hash was good but too salty. The eggs were cooked perfectly. My brunch companions all got burgers and thought they were fine. I stole a french fry from my honey\\'s plate and it was lukewarm inside, obviously not fully cooked from its frozen state. I also couldn\\'t quite figure out the menu theme...Cuban Canadian fusion? <br/><br/>Service was very friendly but a bit inconsistent. Our server was lovely but she seemed to be working mostly on her own, although there were lots of other staff around...who seemed unsure what exactly they should be doing. <br/><br/>This is within walking distance of our friends\\' place so I am sure we will be back...at least for drinks, if nothing else.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Barrel Head, I am so torn. <br/><br/>Sometimes you\\'re a great neighborhood spot to grab a beer/ glass of wine during the week, and other times I feel like I have entered some kind of restaurant Twilight Zone where everyone feels totally fine paying $12 for a handful of poutine. <br/><br/>I\\'ve been here a couple times and I would recommend Barrel Head for their beer/ wine/ general drink menu (especially if you\\'re paying happy hour prices), but the food is....meh... and kind of overpriced. My boyfriend and I came here and ordered a couple things to share, but when the comically small salad arrived we actually thought that we had ordered incorrectly. We asked the waitress if we had ordered a small, but she assured us that the salad was the normal size. <br/><br/>I feel like Barrel Head would normally fit into that particular genre of SF restaurant that gets caught up in the trap of overcharging for their appetizers/food because of the one obscure/artisanal garnish they throw on top, but I can\\'t even say that this is the case. There is nothing really unique about the food and it is too mediocre to merit the prices they are charging. <br/><br/>Great happy hour and great ambiance, just stick to the drinks and don\\'t bother with the food.</p>',\n",

That being said, I\\'ve rarely ever had to wait for a table. <br/><br/>The service is always friendly and quick. <br/><br/>The food has been above average. Last night I got the chill out summer salad - and split the sliders with a friend. The buns were a bit burnt and the meat was so dry we asked for extra bbq sauce. Unfortunately, the thimble sized container of extra sauce they brought over wasn\\'t enough to help and I\\'d say the plate was lacking the m****t factor overall (sorry, I hate that word).

       "  '<p lang=\"en\">I want to LOVE this place so much. They have a lot going for them- location, vibe, and space (it is so big and open and beautiful). <br/><br/>But the prices just don\\'t make this place worth it... and the food could use some work. <br/><br/>To start - they need to figure out their seating - I\\'m not sure if they have a floor chart but they sure were not using it. We were first about to be sat with a guy sitting alone but he was waiting for the rest of his party- the hostess had no clue. Then the hostess just looked a little confused while she scanned the rest of the upstairs hoping to find us an empty table. There was success at the cool communal table, it is a HUGE long piece of wood that can probably seat 15+ people and it faces large windows that look on to Fulton Street. <br/><br/>To drink I had Daniel\\'s Mistress - there was too much ginger beer and tasted rather weak. would not order again.<br/><br/>Food we split:<br/><br/>Poutine - very basic - but good flavor - small portion. Not worth $10 - plus they came out warmish. The gravy SHOULD have been piping hot! <br/><br/>BBQ Pork Ribs - I LOVED the flavor of the ribs, The BBQ sauce was spot on for flavor - not too sweet with a bit of a kick, however, a little too dry and caked on. And the ribs themselves were dry and overcooked. The french fries that came with this dish were hot and delicious. Also the portion size was way too small for the price. <br/><br/>We also tried the brisket - eh. <br/><br/>Overall I would try this place again. But I\\'m going to wait to see if they work out some of the kinks. The service was great and everyone was friendly. Fingers crossed that they have fixes/ changes coming!</p>',\n",

I\\'m inly sad that they have limited space because they are doing some magic with their brews. Super happy to have a local place making sour beer and a nice variety of established beer styles that are far more interesting than the trendy IPA revolution. Happy to see they have a variety of guest beers on tap to compliment their limited offering of house brews and to my delight a brewery that can make cocktails and not just a beer wine list. Happily they are on a great transit route making it easy to drink an extra without fear of driving drunk and happy that they are stumbling I mean walking distance from my home and excited to have a local spot that is not so trendy that I need a reservation.

Decent drought beers to choose from and good service.I like to go here with my family for dinner. Nice atmosphere as well. I usually go for the buffalo mushroom burger. I highly reccommend this place to classic burger fans. That\\'s saying something from me since I\\'m not a huge burger fan.</p>',\n",

I can go get a burger anywhere, for less, that\\'s just as good, if not better. They do have a great beer selection though. I\\'ll give them that. I\\'ve been a few times during different parts of the weekend or during the week, and the service is kinda slow, but everyone is really nice. San Francisco is a city that loves thier bay area teams, you would think that during game time they would put the games on. I went in during a Niner game and asked them to change the channel upstairs to the game, it took about 20 minutes for someone to actually change the channel. <br/><br/>If you do decided to give this place a try, go during brunch.</p>',\n",

They reserved a long table for us upstairs, and assured us that if more people showed up, standing room would be A-OK. Our server even let us keep individual tabs for the night so we (as in, I) wouldn\\'t have to live the nightmare of dealing with a huge tab and having to cover for, em, \"forgetful\" coworkers. The staff dealt with multiple drink and food tabs with much patience and friendliness. If anyone felt stressed about our somewhat disorganized group, no one let it show. Our main server, Niki (sp?) was truly awesome and accommodating.<br/><br/>The space is open and industrial, with lovely touches in the decor, like very subtle etchings of ships and deep sea divers in the wood of the tables. Their house brews are delicious, and they have a plentiful list of great cocktails. Comfort is the word for the food, and it does not disappoint for what it is. <br/><br/>When our time was up at the table and we had to clear out for the next reservation, some of us lingered downstairs to finish our drinks, and it was loud and lively. <br/><br/>I will definitely keep this place on the list for large parties in the future.</p>',\n",

Comfort food at its best. I started with poutine fries. Tasty gravy that\\'s not overpowering with cheese curds over crisp fries. Mmm! A good start to a good meal! Then I had the mix n match bbq. The brisket was fabulous! I had the fatty portion and it was melt in your mouth fantastic. It had a nice smokey touch to it and just dissolved in my mouth with every bite. It came with chicken, bratwurst, and pulled pork! All good but for sure the star was the brisket.<br/>I also tried the dashi noodles. Tons of flavor. Like eating ramen without the soup.

I had to ask my bartender about it because I assumed he just gave me the last couple drops of his last bottle. He said the pour just looked small because of the shape of the glass.

       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Because my main purpose was to have a birthday brunch for my friend, my rating is primarily based on our food experience. The restaurant itself has a great atmosphere and if you\\'re only here for a beer and watch a little sports, it could be a great place to be. Unfortunately, the whole experience was dampened by their food. Not to say that their service was not great because they did have friendly and polite servers, but their quality of the food worth 80% of the grade.<br/><br/>Going back to watching sports, they have a few TV monitors but it\\'s not the biggest screens so base on the ratio of the size of space to the number of TV with its relevant size, there\\'s going to be quite a few blind spots or distance that will prevent you from watching what\\'s going on. Then going back to the food, I ordered the duck confit Benedict and shared the wings with a group of friends. Wings, not bad it had a good spicy level to it. Then it starts to go down hill for me when the benedict arrived. I don\\'t really have to explain what an egg benedict is, but what I got was one hard boiled egg and one benedict egg. That also happened to my friend who ordered the same plate, I\\'m upset because the chef is not consistent with the quality. Then digging a little deeper under the egg, I had practically no duck on one side of my bread and the other had a decent amount. I\\'m sorry, but did the chef decide to only his job on one side of my dish and just gave up in the other half? Then one of my other friend complained about the blandness of their side potatoes and my other friend just didn\\'t like her salad plus they completely forgot the bacon she had asked to add on top of the dish. Just a lot of small little mistakes but it added up to a negative experience. I\\'m going to say if you\\'re looking to dine, go elsewhere. If you\\'re looking just to grab a drink and watch a little sports. Come and try to grab a good vantage point seating.</p>',\n",

       "  '<p lang=\"en\">I\\'ve come here for brunch twice in the last month. The first time we came was on a Sunday around 10:30. The last time was around 11. Both times, there was still seating available. I wondered why any place in SF that served brunch (and bottomless mimosas) didn\\'t have a wait.<br/><br/>The atmosphere was nice -- first time was quiet, second was a little more rambunctious since they had the niners game going. The staff was attentive, give or take. The first visit, they had completely left a meal off the order but quickly rushed that out to us. Although, on the same visit, we were given the previous day\\'s specials menu. Half our party was let down when we found out what we wanted to order wasn\\'t available.<br/><br/>All good, we all found something we wanted instead. To my disappointment, I had the duck benedict. Now, anyone who\\'s ever had a benedict knows that it rides heavily on a perfectly poached egg - a nice firm white with a runny yolk that saturates the tasty bits that sits below it. Well, if that\\'s what you expect, don\\'t order a benedict from here. Of the two times I\\'ve come, a total of five benedicts were ordered (12 eggs were served) and not a single order had a perfectly poached egg! 10 eggs were overcooked with a solid yolk! The other two were undercooked with a translucent white.<br/><br/>Speaking of overcooked, that seemed to have been a theme. The burgers (three ordered) were ordered at a medium but came out well. The flavor was just right, though. The side of fries, might as well be extra crispy which in my book is extra tasty. Somehow, the egg on the burger (+$2) came out with just the right amount of runniness.<br/><br/>The drinks were great! They kept them flowing although you are able to see the bottom of your glass with their bottomless mimosas (there are some SF brunch spots that make sure you\\'re never empty). We also learned that ordering a single mimosa as opposed to the bottomless meant better Champaign. The Lost Compass is a must try as is their pumpkin ale. Lots of choices!<br/><br/>Ultimately, for the price (and food quality), it\\'s going to be a little while until I come back. However, if you have a large group and you\\'re looking for a neat place to grab a drink and some food without the standard 2 hr wait, this is the place!</p>',\n",

       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Update! <br/><br/>A lot of my gripes have been resolved. Wait staff is much better, beer prices seem to have been reduced, and the foot was pretty good! Also they got rid of their bouncer, at least on slow evenings. Bumped from 3 to 4 stars. <br/><br/>Original:<br/><br/>I live so close to this place and desperately want it to succeed. That being said this place is pretty far off the mark from what I think will make a successful, longterm restaurant. I realize the place is only a few weeks old but here are my main complaints:<br/><br/>1) Staff not in line with restaurant aesthetics. I assume the place is trying to serve the Google Glass crowd with a decent, albeit expensive beer list ($12 for a 10oz pour of Delirium Tremens???). If that\\'s the case why do all the waitresses look like they just got off a non-stop flight from the Jersey Shore? Short black cocktail dresses and pink streaks in your hair do not jive with the high end beer crowd. Go recruit from Nopa or Zeitgeist and leave the Applebee\\'s alone. <br/><br/>2) Food is reasonably priced but pretty unimaginative. I know it\\'s the first few weeks and the menu is just getting sorted out but serving what I assume is a tiny assortment of Sysco fries with a burger that our server forgot to put in the system until 15 minutes after we ordered isn\\'t going to cut it. Also the \"crisp lettuce\" was the ass-end of an iceberg wedge that propped the bun up on a fulcrum of mediocrity. <br/><br/>3) Beer list in general. I assume this will be improved as they can kick some of the lesser beers off the taps by adding their own brewed beer. The issue is that while it\\'s great to have 40 beers on tap, the bar has been raised. None of the beers are hard to get at your neighborhood market. I don\\'t claim to know how beer distribution works and maybe you have to give Russian River a pound of flesh to get some pliny but without something unique or hard to come by the honeymoon phase of a new restaurant is going to end and the beer / food is going to have to stand on its own to drive foot traffic. Hopefully their own beer will be awesome but given that the workable space for brewery operations is smaller than my living room I have my doubts.<br/><br/>God speed Barrel Head Brewhouse. I really hope you guys make it because the Upper Haight is in desperate need of more places like the one I assume you envisioned when you started construction.</p>',\n",

I\\'ve been here twice and both times everything was edible but nothing was so good that I felt like I just HAD to have it again. I liked the idea of the grilled fava beans, but they could have used a more intensely flavored sauce than the vinaigrette they came with (balsamic reduction instead maybe?). I was into the alcoholic version of the Arnold Palmer, and they have good beers, but everything else.....<br/><br/>OR... I guess I should be honest about what it is about this place that bugs me and not just dance around the issue: THE MANHATTAN PROJECT. Few things are more upsetting to me than senseless gimmicks. <br/><br/>One of my friends that I was there with ordered a Manhattan (without looking at the menu to see the whole dumb shebang), and the waitress was like, \"Okay, what do you want it made with?\" to which he responded, \"Oh, do you guys have [insert random vermouth here] vermouth?\" ..... \"Oh, ummm, I don\\'t know, I think we just have what\\'s listed here.\" So he looked at the Manhattan Project in their cocktail menu where she directed him and he said, \"Okay, can I get a Manhattan with rye, vermouth, angostura bitters, and a cherry?\" .... In other words, a Manhattan.<br/><br/>I just don\\'t understand how you can give different alcohol options and \"mixer\" options and still call it a Manhattan. A drink made with tequila, aperol, chocolate bitters, and a twist is not a Manhattan, but that\\'s something that you could order from their selections of booze/mixer/bitters/garnish under the Manhattan Project. I think they could have done something really cool if they wanted to pride themselves in having a large selection of whiskeys, vermouths, and bitters and call THAT the Manhattan Project, but what they\\'re doing is just weird. You might as well call it \"The San Francisco Project\" because it has about nothing to do with a Manhattan.<br/><br/>If the food were really good or the cocktails exceptional, I\\'d be able to overlook this thing, but it\\'s front and center on the cocktail menu and is redeemed by not much else.<br/><br/>DON\\'T FOOL YOURSELF, BARREL HEAD.<br/><br/>P.S.

Just a few minutes later the bartender came over and said he would see if he could find some things in the kitchen to use.. and brought me an awesome hot toddy... great customer service like this means I will be back!</p>',\n",

I think this one is my bad and I want to try others.<br/><br/>Food-<br/>Very good food but some of it is overpriced. The poutine is delicious but small. The salad was delicious but again, small for the price. The burger was delicious and for what you get, I thought it was reasonably priced and same with the fish and chips. The side of fries was only 5 dollars but like, you get 10 fries with it. Insane. So, good food, but some of it is not worth it for what you get. <br/><br/>Service-<br/>I\\'ve had great service, no complaints here. <br/><br/>Overall, I\\'m a fan, but I hope they figure out the food sizes and pricing a bit better, right now I would not hesitate to drink here but probably won\\'t eat here as frequently.</p>',\n",

Stain it! <br/><br/>The star of the burger was the meat and the bun, it was awesome. Just wished it had a more substantial lettuce than white iceberg. I\\'ll say it, I wish the menu said what kind of beef it was (every other restaurant in SF does), it is a $13 burger. \\xa0Everyone at the table approved the fries. \\xa0Tried the Mini Monte Christos, they were tasty. \\xa0I highly \\xa0recommend that they add one more salad to the menu.

If you go in on a packed night there is not a lot of places to actually stand. There is an upstairs which I really like, but the stairs are unmarked and the path to get to them is really packed. <br/><br/>The second time I went we had food.

We would not order it again. <br/><br/>Barrel Burger: added the egg and ordered it medium rare. The burger had redeeming qualities. It was nice and juicy and the egg was yolky enough but not too runny which is good when the beef juices are already dripping into your hands.

Eventually I will try something else, probably when I need to remain somewhat sober. The veggie burger was pretty good, both times. <br/><br/>Can\\'t wait to try your own brew.<br/><br/>It would be nice if there were a couple more vegatarian options. Vegetarians like cocktails and drink beer too but will quickly get bored of the same two dinner options and go elsewhere.<br/><br/>It would be nice if this didn\\'t turn into a sports bar. The boys screaming at the tv over the bar on a Saturday night out sorta spoiled the restaurant experience. <br/><br/>The noise level, a bit too loud. Perhaps putting something on the ceiling to buffer the noise would be wise. <br/><br/>Staff has been nice and friendly though things seem a bit chaotic.

I had the mini croque-monsieur and the poutine to start - both are stellar. For my main course I had the Salisbury steak - it a non-traditional spin on an old school dish, revitalized with caramelized onions and gruyere cheese. EPIC.

However, it was really loud, the service a was a bit sloppy and we had to wait an unreasonably long time for our dessert (cheese plate). The kicker: my friend and I split the check, but the next day I saw that I had been charged the full amount, while she was charged half.

I didn\\'t even realize that all the good stuff (butter pecan dressing) was drizzled on the plate underneath until half way through sadly. My husband ordered the brisket and it was just a huge lump of fat. It was so gross. I told him to send it back so we waited and waited for a server to come by but with no luck. I had to get up and actually stand and wait until all the servers stopped chatting in the corner so I could ask her for something else. We ended up getting the burger for him instead which was really good. This place would be good for large group who predominately want to drink and perhaps get some shared plates.

Although I did not intend to use the token as I am very appreciative that I can read there and that isn\\'t something all bars in the city encourage, the next time I went to Barrel Head and ordered a beer, Davin did not charge me-- even though I had not used the token. I had not expected such kindness. <br/>Really good bar for a date, an after work hang out, or time by yourself. The bar attracts a steady crowd of good people-- people who want to relax with friends and enjoy good beer/food. Solid spot and one of my favorite bars in the city.

I was also not impressed with the bourbon promotion. There are two neighborhood whiskey bars a mere 4 blocks away that have better pricing and selection.<br/><br/>The beer list here is the real draw (if they would get more reasonable pricing). And I will be giving them another chance when they start serving their own beer ( which was not ready yet).

       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Ooh lordy is it loud in here. But if you can stand the noise, it\\'s a worthwhile establishment.<br/><br/>Been here a couple times now, once for drinks and dinner and once for brunch. Both times, the food has been outstanding! Above and beyond for \"brewery food.\" I\\'ve had the vegetable risotto and the fries for dinner. Friend said the burger was super tasty. Had the loco moco for brunch and mmmmm I could eat that every day.<br/><br/>They\\'ve got a CRAP-TON (that\\'s the technical term) of beers on tap. I think like over 40? Everything I\\'ve had has been super tasty. Can\\'t wait to try their own beers once their ready. To top it off, there\\'s a super sweet torpedo on the bar that they serve their beers out of.<br/><br/>It gets a little bro-tastic in here or college-y. Eh it\\'s super close to USF so you got to expect that.<br/><br/>Service, I think will improve. Our servers have been super nice and perky but I think they\\'re getting their rhythms and timings worked out. Because it can get so busy, things aren\\'t always super prompt, but not for a lack of trying. I really like the fact that this place is a very local business, that came together from people that actually live in the neighborhood. You can feel their earnestness and that they really want to offer an amazing brewhouse for this community. I really appreciate the fact that they made this place walking distance from my apartment, haha.<br/><br/>This place is definitely a great addition to the neighborhood. I\\'ve been wanting something to go into this vacant space for the last 5 years. There were rumors it would be a brewhouse and now it actually exists. Huzzah.</p>',\n",

I think the servers just need to be a little bit more observant and could be trained in that area.</p>',\n",

       "  '<p lang=\"en\">The restaurant has a great look and vibe. Big place; has a half upstairs and then lots of seating downstairs. I got there about 5:15 and it was pretty empty but we definitely weren\\'t the only ones in there. They have a great drink menu: beers and cocktails. They even have a make your own Manhattan list. That was pretty cool. I would come back just for that. They have fun names for their cocktails too. I ordered their Summer Brew Wheat Ale. Sounded good. Was schmoozing with my friend and didn\\'t notice until I was halfway done that the beer was definitely not a Wheat Ale. It looked and tasted like a Pale Ale. And my receipt said Wheat Ale so either they make a weird Wheat Ale that\\'s actually a Pale Ale or they poured the wrong drink. I don\\'t like Pale Ales all that much so it wasn\\'t great but I\\'m sure if I liked Pale Ales I\\'d probably like it. But on the bright side, happy hour beers were $3! I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever had a beer for that cheap, even Bud Light!<br/><br/>Now on to food. The menu in the restaurant is much more extensive than the menu they have online. They have about 4 more salads, 3 more sandwiches and about 6 other large plate items. I was debating between the cheeseburger, beef sandwich (roast beef w/ au jus), the salisbury steak (comes covered with gruyere and parm) and the brisket. I asked the waitress for a suggestion and she couldn\\'t really give me one, she said everything was good (which was both good and bad; one the one hand, I couldn\\'t go wrong, on the other I was trying to decide and would have loved to hear what she thought). I ended up going with the brisket. The menu provides an option for lean, fatty, or a combo. I asked for it as lean as possible. Food didn\\'t take too long to come out. The brisket looked good. It came with a light coleslaw (not a mayo-based dressing, which was nice), pickles, BBQ sauce and the brisket was sitting on top of a piece of toasted bread. I was disappointed to see there was fat on my meat. Of course, I cut it away but I had asked for it to be super lean. The meat was tasty and the outside crispy but it was a little dry without the BBQ sauce. The BBQ sauce was on the tangy side, I wish it had had more of kick. The cole slaw was pretty good; I rarely eat mayo-based cole slaw but I ate this whole thing. And can\\'t go wrong with pickles.<br/><br/>My friend ordered the wedgie salad. Basically an iceberg wedge with cherry tomatoes, blue cheese, avocado and what they called \\'chicken fried\\' bacon, and a ranch dressing. There was one strip of bacon on the plate and it basically looked like a deconstructed salad. Not sure if my friend was expecting that or not. I asked her how the bacon was because she only ate about half. She said it tasted more like fried chicken than actual bacon. She said it was ok. Salad looked tasty though. <br/><br/>Overall, I\\'d say definitely check it out. It\\'s a fun vibe, great drinks, and a good menu. I think their flatbreads and burgers are what I would try if I go back. They looked really good. I was also a little disappointed that they don\\'t have grilled chicken to add to salads. Only shrimp and I don\\'t eat shellfish. But it\\'s worth trying for sure.</p>',\n",

       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Here I go, writing a review, which I never do. I feel compelled because I want this place to be great. I\\'ll even settle for good. <br/><br/>I followed them on FB before they opened. I shared their posts to drum up more interest to support them. I read about them excitedly in the local newsletter. So when they opened I was a bit disheartened by the terrible food and service. But I was ok with that. They had just opened and needed to work out some kinks. I get it. Not brushing them off, I went back a handful of times over the next few months. Every single time I had horrible service. And every single time I\\'ve been disappointed by their food. But I kept hope. <br/><br/>Fast forward to today. It\\'s been a few months since I\\'ve been. Let\\'s give it a shot, they surely must be more buttoned up by now. Wrong, oh how I was wrong. I actually think it\\'s worse. <br/><br/>It\\'s Sunday, 3:30pm and they are moderately busy. I wait for at least 2 minutes before anyone comes to greet and seat me. Remember, it\\'s only moderately busy. I\\'m starting to get a little worried nothing has improved but I\\'m keeping hope alive! I order a manhattan off their cocktail menu. Not too bad but not great. Just prepare yourself for getting a drink that\\'s only half full. They consistently serve up little drinks, which I wouldn\\'t mind so much but they should put them in a smaller glass. When you get a cocktail that is only half full, it feels as of they are being super cheap or hired a bartender that doesn\\'t know how to measure. <br/><br/>Appetizers come in a timely-ish fashion and aren\\'t bad. The coleslaw for the sliders have zero flavor but it\\'s coleslaw, I\\'m willing to overlook it and keep hope alive!!! When my entree of spare ribs arrive, I\\'m a bit surprised at what I see. They are the saddest, blackest, dryest ribs I\\'ve ever seen. And I feel a bit deceived, nowhere on the menu did it say they would be covered in a dry rub with BBQ sauce on the side. But I\\'ll let it go, I don\\'t like to put up a fuss about my food. When I finally take a bite it\\'s like eating jerky, sad flavorless jerky. I have no choice but to send my food back, which I can honestly say I\\'ve never done. The waitress even looks like she was expecting it. I order the cubano since I\\'ve had it before and found it to be ok. One would think that the replacement order would go to the front of the line in the kitchen. Time passes. More time passes. My husband and my kids have long finished eating and even more time passes. This entire time the waitress didn\\'t once come back to let me know that the kitchen is even working on it. At this point I can no longer occupy my 3 and 4 year old, we have to go, it\\'s been at least 1.5 hours since we sat down. I tell the waitress we have to go because my kids are restless. When I get the bill they apologize, which I appreciate, and offer us a round of drinks. Uhhhh, I just said we have to go because we can\\'t stay any longer but thanks. In the end they took 15% off our bill but unless things dramatically improve, I\\'ll be spending my dollars elsewhere. (I still maintain a weeeeee bit of hope).</p>',\n",

       "  '<p lang=\"en\">hmmmmm, so i soooooo wanted to give this place more stars!!! but i\\'ve been here 5+ times and just can\\'t. i live in the neighborhood and wanted so much more from this space that has been vacant for some 10+ years!<br/><br/>first of all, each time i have been there i have sat at the bar and each time not one of the bartenders could have been more bothered to simply acknowledge me, let alone as me if i wanted to order something. when they finally got around to asking they had such attitude that it felt uncomfortable asking any questions. not to mention they did not know the menu at all! guys, train your staff on food and drink options *before* putting them on the floor. having staff say \"i have no idea\" and not offer to go find out is not ok.<br/><br/>one time i ordered just french fries and a drink. i had to ask for water refills, a napkin to go with my fries, as well as condiments as the bartender didn\\'t bring me any of the above.<br/><br/>another time i ordered drinks and a burger, medium rare. drink came and it was good - a sazerac. burger came and, #1 it was nowhere near medium rare, but was more medium well, and brown. and \\xa0#2, the bun was so \"toasted\" i could barely bite into it. i didn\\'t ask for a re-do because it took so long to get to me and i was *starving*! overall, however, the burger was tasty, but not something i\\'m dying to go back for. especially not for $13+.<br/><br/>and lastly, i know the owner is trying hard, but he has introduced himself to me more than 3 times, but each time he has NO idea who i am. i know he meets a lot of people, but make some effort to remember people who come in often.<br/><br/>overall, for me, this place has a lot of work to do. prices are high for the neighborhood, staff is absolutely uninterested in what they\\'re doing, the staff drinks at the bar while working (ok, at the end of the shift, but not at 4:00pm!), food is just ok. i was SO looking forward to something great in this space since it has has been vacant for so long, but this just isn\\'t cutting it for the long haul :-(<br/><br/>i\\'m hoping things will improve and i can change my mind about this place!</p>',\n",

       "  '<p lang=\"en\">I came here to have dinner after a relative told me the place had turned into this awesome bar/restaurant in the last month. I sat at the bar and the bartenders were all very attentive and pleasant and made me some killer drinks, vodka gimlet with just the right amount of citrus. My food my was a surprising delightful experience of non-traditional bar food: tuna tartare which is a personal favorite. I was a little skeptical of trying it being that this was a bar...but I was pleasantly surprised when it came out with what looked like puréed dollops of avocado cream all around it. The taste was amazing and so much more than I expected. I tried an asparagus salad with oranges which again was the perfect compliment of salty and tangy citrus and a chicken dish with chicken sausage and wild rice which was to die for. In asking who the chef was, come to find out there is a new guy named Graham House who helped transform the former menu into something I\\'ve rarely seen at a bar. You will not be disappointed dining here and will definitely want to come back again for more!</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Been looking forward to this new brewery for a long time. The neighborhood has really needed something like this and you can tell from the hoards of people that many agree. The atmosphere inside is great and many of the people involved in the Brewery live in the neighborhood which adds to the communal feel. So far, the beer list is excellent &amp; they\\'ll be brewing their own stuff in 6 weeks (looking forward to that the most of course). I tried the burger &amp; risotto. Both excellent. They could use a few more menu items, but I think that will come in time. The chef (from Monk\\'s Kettle) is clearly talented. Overall, great food &amp; drink with unpretentious and spirited atmosphere. No doubt a gathering spot for years to come...</p>',\n",

First, never ever put poutine on a menu unless you\\'ve actually been to canada. Simply put, it\\'s a joke. Second, a duvel is $12. Ouch. Also, I\\'m not sure the crowd cares much about what\\'s on the plate. Will not repeat. They\\'ll roll in all kinds of cash due to proximity to the USF campus but that doesn\\'t mean it\\'s worth it. Maybe they\\'ll dial it in? One can hope.</p>',\n",
