The plate comes with blue rice (similar texture to basmati), a really large piece of chicken (with a sort of sweet and sour sauce) plus naan and curry. Everything on the plate compliments the other sections. It\\'s $22 but well worth and easily split into two meals (which is what i did). DEFINITELY REC THIS DISH.<br/><br/>Boyfriend ordered the fried rice and that was also delicious for $15. Ingredients were fresh and great, but I think I\\'m more willing to pay for lesser quality at a lower price.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">I should preface this review by saying that I\\'m not a big fan of Thai food. Farmhouse Kitchen is definitely an exception though! I\\'ve had both lunch and dinner here and enjoyed everything. The food and decor is pretty unique so at the very least you\\'ll get to experience something you probably haven\\'t by coming here (is blue rice a thing??). The food itself is tasty and fresh and the portions are satisfying. Overall a great place to bring friends although it can get quite loud during dinner.<br/><br/>Just don\\'t tell anyone it\\'s your birthday for the sake of the other diners--by the 4th drum accompanied birthday recital I was pretty jaded.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">You would think with the 2:1 staff to customer ratio here they would be able to facilitate a to go order at 5:30pm. Left me sitting at the bar for 20 minutes only to discover my food is ready and has just been... sitting there. <br/><br/>@ $16 for basic pad Thai that is half bean sprouts you could at least tell me it\\'s ready. <br/><br/>I even tipped in advance :( regret regret regret</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Please help me understand the hype? Maybe because I grew up in Berkeley I\\'ve been spoiled with amazing Thai food, but I really wasn\\'t amazed by the food here. <br/><br/>I tried the fried chicken dish as recommended and for me, the batter was a bit too soft. I would have liked it to have more crunch and carb as opposed to just melting in my mouth. The chicken, however, was very tender which I appreciated.<br/><br/>I also ordered the pad Thai. Again, I wasn\\'t impressed and actually it was a bit too sweet for me. I ordered it with prawns, and to my delight, the prawns were nicely sized and cooked well.<br/><br/>For dessert, I ordered the sticky mango rice. Ok- this dish is was amazing and I most definitely may come back here just for this dish alone. The rice was a blue/purple color and it was super chewy and sweet. I also appreciated the way they sliced the mango to be extra thin and artful. Small details like that get me excited.<br/><br/>Overall experience: 7/10? Parking was also not easy.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Group dining or date night, Farmhouse Thai is the perfect place for a food-focused night out. <br/><br/>Inside is cuuuute the dishes are detailed and thoughtful and you can get delicious twists on both your Thai and American faves. <br/><br/>I usually get anything with either crab or prawns - if I had to pick between the two, I\\'d say the prawn dishes are a better bang for your buck. <br/><br/>For apps the Ahi scoops aren\\'t super plentiful but they\\'re sooo good. Maybe my fave. At least top 3 things here. <br/><br/>The vegan spring rolls are beautiful and super good, too. <br/><br/>Their Tom Yum soup is p good but there\\'s like half-tomato sized chunks of tomato. It\\'s hard to even get it on the spoon and it\\'s the kind of thing where if you\\'re getting a thing of soup you probably don\\'t want 1/3 of your order to be single half tomato. <br/><br/>Oh and the herbal rice salad is as beautiful as it is tasty. <br/><br/>Oh and I heard that on some special Friday nights they have Thai street food baskets of fried bugs that sound so cool. Need to come back to try.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">My only regret from my trip to Farmhouse Kitchen, is that I couldn\\'t try more things from the menu! I find this to be the case with so many places I eat in San Francisco because I know the likelihood of going to the same place twice is very slim. And with this meal with just my wife and I, you can\\'t be a gluttonous fool and order the 10 things that sound good. But I digress.<br/><br/>I love unique and very local feeling places. And when we were dropped off in an off-the-beaten path neighborhood and then seated by a tiny asian man dressed in drag, I got the warm fuzzies that we were in for a treat.<br/><br/>After VERY much deliberation of what we wanted to get, we ultimately said we will split an appetizer and go on our own for the entree. Not the most ideal for trying multiple items. But with one shot at this, my wife and I decided selfish decisions had to made. To start, we got the Neua Num Tok Rolls. It was not at all like I expected. But the \"rolls\" were actually the extremely tender flavorful Wagyu beef. The savory flavors of the meat mixed so well with the cold, crunchy cucumber and mint. This was an incredibly, well designed dish that had such good complimenting flavors.<br/><br/>I decided to go with apparently what they are most famous for, the Hat Yai fried chicken. That was one decision I will never regret. It came with a yellow curry that was nearly as good as the chicken itself. But throw in some blue rice and get a nice forkful of curry and chicken... sheer bliss. It was absolutely amazing. I could not consider giving this place even the thought of anything less than 5 stars.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">I\\'ve heard about this place for a while and I\\'ve been wanting to go to this place for months! I think it lives up to the hype but too bad the wait is always so bad here. We had to wait around 30 - 45 minutes and this was around 8 pm for three people.<br/><br/>All in all the food is pretty good. We had the green curry, the pad see ew (I think) and the ribeye special. They were a bit pricey, but it was pretty good so can\\'t complain there. The appetizer was pickled vegetables and those I didn\\'t really like, I\\'m not really into pickled things.<br/><br/>I\\'d highly recommend this place, but you should try and get reservations here! This place had a lively atmosphere, cute interior decoration and all the staff wore some traditional, tikki kind of looking outfits which was kind of cute as well. At least the food came out decently fast as well.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">I and two coworkers took an Uber to this Mission area Thai Restaurant. \\xa0My buddy and his wife raved about the food here, especially the green curry and shrimp dishes. \\xa0After our meal, I\\'m inclined to say that its definitely one of the better Thai restaurants I\\'ve been in SF. \\xa05 stars. IMHO its a step ahead of Osha Thai and Kin Khao. In fact, Kin Khao should give its 1-Michelin Star to Farmhouse. \\xa0I\\'ll have to bookmark Marnie Thai on 23rd for next time.<br/><br/>The restaurant is in a somewhat remote area on Florida St, across from a residential area. \\xa0Outside, it looked nothing like a Thai Restaurant, but instead something rustic like you\\'d find in Napa. \\xa0We all ordered family style and pretty much enjoyed all the dishes:<br/><br/>1. Mieng Kum Kung: Appetizer of three perfectly fried prawns served on a green leaf with minced ginger, lime, coconut, tamarind, and yes peanuts. \\xa0Elevated coconut shrimp with some serious jacked-up flavors. (5 stars)<br/><br/>2. Green Curry with Mary\\'s Chicken: Served with Thai eggplant. \\xa0Curry was excellent - not watered down and moderately spicy. \\xa0Chicken was moist. \\xa0They served this with blue flower rice! (5 stars)<br/><br/>3. Pad Kee Mao: Vegetarian version of spicy Drunken Noodles, and pretty good. \\xa0The color is lighter than I\\'m used to seeing, but the spicy kick is definitely there without the excess oiliness. (4 stars)<br/><br/>4. Pad Char Shrimp: Excellent sautéed shrimp in red curry, but the real winner is that amazing green cilantro-based dip that was similar to an Indian chutney, but with intense Thai kick. \\xa0Comes with more blue flower rice which was a hit (5 stars).</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Came to Farmhouse Kitchen Thai and left very content. My friends and I tried a variety of dishes and really enjoyed the bold, SPICY, flavors used in their dishes.<br/><br/>We started off the meal with the Par Dip Fresh Tuna which features fresh Maguro tuna tossed in a mix of green onions, cilantro, dill, coriander, and dehydrated chili. The flavors were aromatic and delicious, but that chili was definitely a kicker. It was bold and took us by surprise on just how spicy it was. Take caution.<br/><br/>Their complementary tap is good though and enough to temper the heat if you don\\'t want to go the extra mile to order a fresh coconut. Their tap was infused with mint and limes too!<br/><br/>As for the Yum Moo Krob, the pork belly pieces were delicious. Mint and shallots gave it a sweet, yet refreshing undertone on an otherwise rich and meaty cube of pork belly. However, to call it a salad was a little excessive. It was literally a wedge of cabbage that you had to saw apart. It wasn\\'t really conducive to tossing like a traditional salad.<br/><br/>For main entrees, we shared Thai Street Green Curry Noodles, Spicy Eggplant, and Khao Mun Gai. I thought the curry was absolutely delicious. I loved the addition of figs to give it a nice sweet surprise. Some of the other garnishes were just okay in my opinion - I always love the addition of bamboo shoots and bell peppers because they tend to withstand the cooking process and stay crisp. However, the green beans were almost mushy. In regards to protein, it wasn\\'t a lot for the price point, but the dish itself will be more than enough to fill you up. As for the Spicy Eggplant, I thought it was done very well. It wasn\\'t too oily and the pieces were very substantial. Lastly, the hainan chicken rice. I thought the chicken was a little dry, but when paired with the broth and variety of sauces, had really good flavor. That said, my favorite part of this dish was the broth. It was so light and the daikon inside provided a lovely sweet flavor. The rice lacked some flavor compared to other versions I\\'ve had prior.<br/><br/>Additionally, the bowls of rice provided were...blue...it was odd. It\\'s not purple rice...just blue.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed our meal. It\\'s definitely an elevated style of Thai cooking. Flavors were phenomenal, presentation was beautiful, but it\\'s definitely a pricey choice in my opinion for ingredients that weren\\'t otherworldly unique.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Reservations on the weekends are a must! Multiple friends had to give up eating here previously, since they tried to walk in and it was over an hour wait. Luckily for me, my friend had her birthday dinner here and we were able to get reservations for a large group on a Saturday night. They packed in 12 to one table, and a few of us had to sit in an uncomfortable corner spot; however, it was worth it for the food! The ambiance here is very eclectic and lively- some of the male staff have makeup on, wear dresses, and are hilariously sassy. This was perfect for a group birthday dinner, and we tried:<br/><br/>Drinks:<br/>-Sparking Peach Jelly (Pink Moscato, Sparkling Peach Jello, $12, <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=h6NXWQjiF1EQYAlT-Wq5fg&amp;userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg\">yelp.com/user_local_phot…</a>): Yum, this was a very unique drink with actual jello pieces in it. It was very light and refreshing, and not too sweet- recommended!<br/>-Kick Boxing Bowl (Brut, \"Sato\" Unfiltered Rice Wine, Passion Fruit, Lychee, Umami Chili Salt, Served in Ratchaburi Bowl, 36oz/$32, <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=XaDAdwbj0x3TbCz87Z0bvQ&amp;userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg\">yelp.com/user_local_phot…</a>): You can\\'t taste the alcohol in here much, or the fruit flavors. This was a very light drink, and difficult to share since the straws are super tall. I probably wouldn\\'t get it again.<br/><br/>Food:<br/>-Neua Num Tok Rolls (Wagyu Beef Wrapped w/Mint, Cilantro, Cucumber, Served w/Cilantro Lime Vinagrette, 4/$14.50, <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=__xSIWPwtDhRVqHvCy4Dag&amp;userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg\">yelp.com/user_local_phot…</a>): Delicious! The beef had a great sear, and the flavors worked really well together- recommended!<br/>-Ahi Scoops (Pan-Seared Sesame Crusted Ahi Tuna, Cucumber, Seaweed Salad, Crispy Yam, Dill, Lemongrass, Chili Lime, $13.50, <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=WVrgd4hhfeKuszxEkbOyrw&amp;userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg\">yelp.com/user_local_phot…</a>): A little too spicy, which I rarely say. I loved the spice, but it overpowered the subtle taste of the tuna. There also weren\\'t enough scoops- skip!<br/>-Mieng Kum Kung (Crispy Prawns on Lettuce, Wrapped w/a Zesty Mixture of Lime, Ginger, Onion, Roasted Coconut, Peanuts, Tamarind Sauce, 3/$13, <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=cmgVmnXZoWiVOtZHbmwfbg&amp;userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg\">yelp.com/user_local_phot…</a>): Yum- this was my favorite out of the appetizers. The crispy prawns were large, and cooked perfectly, and the tamarind sauce was delicious- recommended!<br/>-Kai Yang, Som Tum (Half BBQ Chicken Marinated in Turmeric &amp; Coconut Milk, Papaya Salad, Sticky Rice, Roasted Rice Sauce, $21.50, <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=SePPjJ1mt4D4LS_JhkQdXA&amp;userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg\">yelp.com/user_local_phot…</a>): Yum- the chicken was flavorful and cooked really well, and the presentation was amazing. They also give you a giant portion- reocmmended!<br/>-Hat Yai Fried Chicken (Chicken Breast, Turmeric, Herbs, Fried Shallots, Roti Bread, Potato Yellow Curry, Blue Rice, $19.50): Super crispy exterior, and they give you a giant portion! However, I don\\'t like chicken breast, and it was a little dry inside, so I wouldn\\'t get this dish again.<br/>-Penang Neua (Slow Braised Bone-in Short Rib in Penang Curry, Grilled Broccolini, Bell Pepper, Onion, Fried Basil, Served w/Blue Rice, $25.50, <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=jyYfXyc7_f6cEChP9GF_CA&amp;userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg\">yelp.com/user_local_phot…</a>): The flavors were great, but I wished they gave you more penang curry (it seemed like the short rib was just dunked it in quickly). I also wished the short rib had a bit more fat to it. The majority of the meat was tender, but there were a few spots were it was dry. I probably wouldn\\'t get this again just because there are so many other more delicious dishes!<br/>-Tom Yum Noodle Soup (Salmon, Calamari, Shrimp, Scallops, Egg Noodles in Spicy &amp; Sour Broth, Spinach, Broccolini, Bean Sprouts, $17.50): The tom yum soup was really good, and had complex flavors. They also didn\\'t skimp on the seafood. However, I\\'m not a big noodle soup person, so wouldn\\'t get this again.<br/>-Pad Thai ($15, <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=OvAAaaa-_umtvVHRV6S_Fw&amp;userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg&amp;utm_campaign=www_photo_share_popup&amp;utm_medium=copy_link&amp;utm_source=(direct))\">yelp.com/user_local_phot…</a>: Yum- this was a really good version of pad thai, if you like your noodles on the sweeter side. I loved how all the flavors worked together- recommended!<br/>-Thai Vacation (Half Fresh Coconut Filled w/Black Sticky Rice, Vanilla Ice Cream, Coconut Cream, Peanuts, Black Sesame, $9.50): Super unique and delicious! I loved the slices of fresh coconut in there, and the coconut cream was really good. <br/>-Croissant Bread Pudding (Vanilla Ice Cream, Caramel Sauce, $10): This was an interesting take on bread pudding, and it was good, but not as fluffy/chewy as I was expecting for a bread pudding. This is worth trying once, but I\\'d order the Thai Vacation again over this.<br/><br/>Overall, this was a really fun dinner, and a few of the dishes were also unique. Service was solid, and but parking can be difficult.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">UNLIKE ANY Thai food you will have! Hidden gem of the Mission. Great food and fun dining experience! <br/><br/>[FOOD]<br/>- HAT YAI FRIED CHICKEN [5/5]: Flavorful and tender fried chicken, comes with blue rice, yellow curry, and roti bread. The combination is so lovely. It\\'s a perfect balance of carbs, protein, and fat, and also savory and sweet. The curry goes with everything - rice, roti, or even the chicken! Not your typical fried chicken also - very thin, crispy skin. 100% recommend! <br/><br/>- 24 HOUR BEEF NOODLE [4/5]: Large bowl of noodle with beef (rib?) that melts in your mouth. This is the perfect comfort food. The soup does not leave you feeling thirsty. <br/><br/>- YELLOW CURRY [4.5/5]: Recommend if you like sweet curry! This curry is like of like the one from the Hat Yai Fried Chicken. It comes with potato pieces and roti bread. Recommend to order with pork belly! They add a nice chewy texture to the curry. <br/><br/>- PAPAYA SALAD [3/5]: Flavorful but very spicy! You can tell that it\\'s made fresh because of the nice crunch to the veggies. But the serving size is pretty small and 50% of the plate is cabbage. <br/><br/>[SETTING/SERVICE]<br/>I love the set-up of this place! Lots of open space and natural sunlight, and not too crammed. The long tables sort of give this place a \"farmhouse\" feel. Even during the busiest hours, our food was ready within 10 minutes. I have been here 3 times and the service have all been very nice and quick. <br/><br/>[PRICE]<br/>Recommend family style so you could try different dishes! Each entree ranged from $14-25. It is a little pricey for normal Thai food but it\\'s worth the value. Expect to pay ~$20/person. <br/><br/>[PARKING]<br/>Pretty easy to find street parking around this area of the Mission!<br/><br/>This has become one of my favorite places to take my friends to when they are in SF. I have been here 3 times in the past 2 months, and I have not gotten tired of it. I\\'m looking forward to my next visit!</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Upscale/trendy thai food! Very cute restaurant with very tasty food! <br/><br/>The menu items are little bit on the pricey side and the portions are individual portions that aren\\'t really meant for sharing.<br/><br/>Bathrooms are kind of weird in that it looks like it\\'s roomy enough to be multi-stalled but there\\'s only one exposed toilet and a bunch of sinks. Lock the door once you\\'re in.<br/><br/>Parking is available on the street.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">I was nervous about coming here after seeing so many reviews mention the lack of vegan/vegetarian options; what assuaged my fears, though, was the business owner responses saying they were more than willing to make substitutions in order to accommodate dietary needs. So:<br/>1) Kudos to them for doing that!; it feels like more and more restaurants are refusing to swap out ingredients for whatever reasons (it\\'s too much work, they \"know best\" how the dish should taste, etc). Bend don\\'t break, chefs, because we\\'re all paying attention.<br/>2) Proof to business owners that responding to reviews makes a HUGE difference to your potential customer base!<br/><br/>I came with a large group and there seemed to be some hiccups regarding initial service (I think, for example, we were supposed to have those individual coconut drinks waiting for all of us, but that never played out), but it mostly smoothed out over the course of the evening.<br/><br/>I shared a bottle of wine because the cocktails all seemed to have beer; I was really expecting there to be a bigger, more interesting drink list. Folks I was dining with got the Kick Boxing Bowl (brut, rice wine, passion fruit, lychee, and chili salt), and I was immediately jealous. Expensive, but worth it from the looks of it/them towards the end of it! <br/><br/>The food, for me at least, was much more awesome than I was expecting. The Vegan Fresh Rolls (with tofu, mixed greens, bean sprouts, and a chili peanut sauce) were delicious. The rice paper roll was thicker, stickier, and gooier (for lack of a better word) then any other fresh roll I\\'ve had, but that made them interesting and different. If you\\'re coming here with friends who aren\\'t plant-based eaters, I\\'d suggest getting an order just for yourself! For my main I had the Yellow Curry with Tofu (sans fish sauce). It was very, very tasty. There are times when I\\'m glad I don\\'t have to share with my omnivore friends, and this was one of them. The bowl of food contained a hearty portion of potato, tofu, and sauce with several wedges of perfectly made roti bread. I also got a side of sticky rice to ladle it on top of (pro tip, right there). Ate until I was beyond full, and don\\'t regret it (reason number #433 why I wear yoga pants all the time: their stretchiness).<br/><br/>The atmosphere is colorful, vibrant, and definitely different from anything in Maine. And, yes, the bathrooms are the size of studio apartments and worth checking out!</p>',\n",

Highly recommend \\xa0and plenty to share! We also enjoyed their THAI fried rice with Pork. Many dishes can be substituted with either pork, chicken, seafood or vegetables. The rice was cooked perfectly and the vegetables were extremely fresh with great Thai spices. <br/><br/>Good selection of beers and wine! I recommend their delicious Thai Ice Tea! <br/><br/>Location is a little difficult for parking so be prepared to search for an open spot or take mass transit or Lyft if you are already in the City. <br/><br/>Great lunch!

I definitely did not have anything that I disliked - it all ranged from good to great! One thing I will never forget is that I tried a cricket for the first time here -\\xa0it didn\\'t taste like much of anything, it was just crunchy. <br/><br/>There were a couple of things that were a little too spicy for my liking, but Thai Tea helped numb that heat, as it always does. <br/><br/>Looking back at my pictures (that I didn\\'t upload because I\\'m a bad Yelper) I really had some amazing food at this dinner. The thing that makes this review difficult to write, is that I wasn\\'t in charge of ordering, so I don\\'t even know what half the dishes were called. While my review might not be that helpful in terms of specific things to order, what I can tell you is that I sampled so many different plates, and really enjoyed all of it. <br/><br/>I can confidently say that you can\\'t go wrong with just about anything on the menu - just make sure it\\'s not too spicy for ya!</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Their fried chicken is a must here! The batter is so light and crispy! This place can be a bit noisy, so trying to talk to your friends about how their engagement went was a bit difficult to hear without shouting \"WHAT?\" several times. The atmosphere here is very lively and makes you feel like you are in Thailand. I thought it was pretty cool how they had a lady walking around with a bucket of freshly fried calamari. Of course we had to get a plate!<br/><br/>Food:<br/>Hat Yai Fried chicken - AWESOME! So crunchy and juicy at the same time! It wasn\\'t too greasy where it left you feeling heavy at the end of the meal, which was great. The blue rice, roti bread and yellow curry added a nice touch to the dish.<br/><br/>Tom Yum Gai- Lots of flavor and really good! Usually some places make it too sweet, but this place made it justttt right. <br/><br/>Green Curry - WARNING! It is quite SPICY for those who can\\'t take spice. I love spicy foods and even then it was a bit spicy for me, but I loved it nonetheless. Great flavor and spices!<br/><br/>Overall, everything was excellent. Service was great, food was awesome, atmosphere was fun and lively. A bit loud, but still enjoyable. Definitely recommend this place to anyone who loves to escape to an exotic country for the night!</p>',\n",

There\\'s something for everyone, but it\\'s hard not to want to hoard every dish to yourself.

The cucumber was cool and crisp.<br/><br/>The short rib was succulent. The meat was so tender it came off the bone easily. The purple dyed jasmine rice was good.<br/><br/>The yellow potato curry was savory. Dip that with roti, oh so mouthwatering. <br/><br/>The chicken wings were good. It was my least favorite dish. <br/><br/>We ordered so many dishes I can\\'t remember all of them but I remember they were all delicious. <br/><br/>The desert was Thai Vacation.

       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Do it for the culture they said. So I went and got to experience some of the Thai culture but since I\\'ve never been to Thailand, it was hard to know whether anything is authentic. But authenticity is tricky when it comes to food because in my opinion, good food is good food. Authenticity be damn because the \"real\" versions of any popular dish may be a real crapshoot. <br/><br/>Farmhouse gets kudos from me though. Their wait staff seem to be Thai and the menu had some great dishes, both in presentation and taste. \\xa0We tried the steak roll appetizer and the meat was amazingly tender. It wrapped with cucumbers, mint and other flavorful things that I couldn\\'t make out but it was delicious. \\xa0Pad Thai was okay and I wish it had more noodles. I think this was more presentation than anything else. They also only give you two prawns with it. Really? You\\'re better than that Farmhouse! Lastly, we also tried the beef short rib that was tender off the bone. It had his curry like sauce that I used to mop up some of the blue rice. Highly recommend for meat lovers out there.<br/><br/>So if your thing is to bring Thailand over to America in the Mission District of San Francisco, you may be more critical than I am. However, if you\\'re an amateur foodie like myself, then you\\'ll like this place. Plus, you can drink right out of a whole young coconut.</p>',\n",

The Turmeric-marinated BBQ Chicken served with black sticky rice is also very juicy. Soups and curries are also authentic and jam packed with multidimensional flavors.<br/><br/>The portions are generous, make sure you gather a group of 4-6 so you can you all can eat family style, share a larger range or variety. <br/><br/>Sometimes the waiters carry around these baskets with bamboo sticks and inside are these little coconut sticky treats that are worth a try!</p>',\n",

Think ramen broth meets store bought noodles and place some meat on that and charge $30 and you have my dish.<br/><br/>My friend\\'s meat dish had blue (Smurf coloured rice) which she said was too salty, and my Thai tea was like a snow cone with all that ice.<br/><br/>The coconut ice cream was melting when we got it, and frankly wasn\\'t all that good.<br/><br/>Overhyped, and not worth us driving to the Mission for, that\\'s for sure.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Be prepared to FEAST.<br/><br/>Came for dinner on a Saturday evening, and we were told the wait would be an 45-1 hour. Didn\\'t make a reservation. Luckily, Farmhouse is close by to many good spots like a brewery and my favorite cocktail bar.<br/><br/>We dipped into Trick Dog a few feet away, had drinks then came back when they texted me. The best part is that the service at Farmhouse is friendly and so beautiful. Everyone there is so full of love and smiles. The music is super festive, and the decor and colors at Farmhouse give off such a party-all-day vibe. Great spot for groups, date, or family.<br/><br/>The food is the name of the game here. Their samosas are so good. Flaky and veggie-friendly--GET IT. Boo ordered the chicken legs which a guy walked around carrying, almost reminiscent of street vendor style ordering in those Southeast Asian countries. Chicken legs are 2 for $3, which he said was yummy but not really worth the price (better bang for your buck at dim sum spots). The prawn pad thai is delicious and the noodles are cooked to perfection, but a bit too sweet. Red curry is so flavorful, and well enjoyed with jasmine (looked blue/green!) or their sticky rice which comes in a bamboo cup. Portions are humungous. We definitely overate for 2 people...and even had to take our rice home to eat tomorrow. <br/><br/>In all, the food is so delicious, and even sitting at the bar or at a communal table will be fun. There aren\\'t purse hooks at their bar seating, but you do get full view of their drinks being made and extra pickled veggies if you ask nicely. Most of their cocktails run on the sweet side, but their flower spritzer is more refreshing with elderflower and bubbly. I had the Ya-Dong set, which is a set of 2 shots that come with a Singha back. The best way I can describe it as a Taiwanese kid is that one tastes like the herbal chicken soup my mom used to make me drink when I was on my period, and the other red one tastes like super old Chinese herbs that you imagine when you watch old Asian time period shows.<br/><br/>Prices are affordable for SF standards but on the $$$ side. We basically paid $40 per person for our feast--but we did order too much. It feels like such a party, and we weren\\'t even celebrating anything! Music and the hustle and bustle makes you feel like you\\'re enjoying street food in the comfort of a modern and clean restaurant. I would totally come back again, but expect to wait.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Hidden gem in the Outer Mission, for sure. Can\\'t even remember how I first found this spot...but there\\'s a ton of great spots around this one block radius (Trick Dog, etc)! Farmhouse Kitchen has got the vibes of an authentic bustling Thai street restaurant (minus the street feel) - you\\'ll get it once you\\'re there! <br/><br/>Tip 1: make reservations if you\\'re planning ahead. This place gets PACKED. Tried coming here once at 7:45pm on a Saturday and was told it\\'d be a 1.5hr+ wait. No, thanks. Made reservations for tonight\\'s dinner...and by the time my group was leaving around 8:30pm, there were still at least 6+ groups waiting to be seated? On a Wednesday night! <br/><br/>Tip 2: add some buffer time prior to arrival to find parking! Parking is really a hit or miss around this area. Now with all the apartments and restaurants and bars in the area, it\\'s a bit tougher :/<br/><br/>Tip 3: share the dishes! They\\'re HUGE. I can never finish my own entrees. And I always get apps on top of the entrees. This is by no means a cheap dinner spot, but they compensate that with their extra large dishes. They\\'re honestly shareable sizes. <br/><br/>Tonight I had the fried calamari and seared tuna for apps. For my main I had the green curry with seafood. Even though all my dishes sound pretty basic, Farmhouse\\'s seasoning game is real strong! The fried calamari paired with the perfectly homemade(?) sweet and sour dipping sauce. And my green curry had just the right amount of kick, topped with fresh seafood and greens. I thought I was really hungry before dinner, but couldn\\'t even get through half my curry! <br/><br/>Our particular server could\\'ve been a bit more lively, but he got the job done without being rude. There\\'s a lot going on, and definitely a fun environment overall.<br/><br/>All in all, Farmhouse is a great spot to come by once in a while! Am I going to spend $45 on dinner every night? No. But would I come back for a fun get together occasion? Yes. 4 stars!</p>',\n",

This 2017 Michelin Recommended joint was worth the hype!<br/><br/>Started off with a few appetizers. The tuna with wonton chips were tasty and flavorful as the tuna had a nice kick to it. <br/><br/>Moved on to the Thai sausage which was a smaller portion and very flavorful. Sausage wasn\\'t too dry either.<br/><br/>Last appetizer was the Thai fish cake which had a phenomenal presentation, flavors that were on point, despite a smaller portion, compared with Lers Ros.<br/><br/>Thai Iced tea was pricier than most although it was strong and flavorful.<br/><br/>Highlight of the meal was the Hat Yai fried chicken which lived up to the hype. Portions were huge and perfect for sharing. Fried Mary\\'s chicken breast was very juicy and flavorful. The roti and curry dipping sauce made this dish over the top!<br/><br/>Service was pleasant as well.<br/><br/>~$37/head after tax and gratuity for a hearty lunch.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">I was very excited to eat at Farmhouse Kitchen after hearing so many great things about it. I really wish I liked it more, but I\\'m giving it 3.5 stars. <br/><br/>Stand outs:<br/>-The 24 beef noodle soup- my favorite dish. Incredible flavor and the meat was tender. Really reminded me of boat noodles. However, my boyfriend said he prefers the boat noodles at Zen Yai over this rendition. <br/>-The curry that came with the hat yai fried chicken. YUM. I could eat that sauce with anything. <br/><br/>Okay: <br/>-The shrimp pad thai and red beef curry were alright. I\\'ve had around the same at other thai places. The beef in the curry was pretty hard. <br/>-I didn\\'t think the hat yai chicken was anything special, despite all of the raving reviews. It was fried pretty well, but other than that, it was pretty small and wasn\\'t extremely tender or anything. <br/><br/>The not-so-great:<br/>-The Thai sausage appetizer- okay flavor but kind of dry. Tiny portions.<br/>-The service. None of the waiters were very welcoming. We felt rushed the entire time, as waiters tried to clear dishes before we even finished eating, without asking! Literally a second after putting down the fork, there would be someone at the table, trying to take away the dish, even if there was still food on it. This happened like 4 times.<br/><br/>Overall, pretty decent Thai food but nothing you can\\'t get at other Thai restaurants.</p>',\n",

       "  '<p lang=\"en\">I live about 1.5 blocks away and I can\\'t believe it took me over a year to come to Farmhouse. This is much more authentic than your average Thai restaurant, with real spices and genuine dishes. The decor reminds me of Lolo - colorful, fun, quirky. This is expressed in so much of what they do - the waitstaff wears bright Hawaiian shirts, the way they sing Happy Birthday (cymbals are involved), the overall vibe. This is really a fun spot, and for a relatively quiet area, always busy!<br/><br/>RESERVATIONS: Definitely needed. We were a group of 10 on a Friday night. I\\'ve also seen a wait outside on many a weeknight walking my dog past this restaurant. <br/><br/>COCKTAILS<br/>* Coco Lada ($12) - 3.5 stars<br/>Great sweet, tropical drink, just gets watery very quickly! <br/><br/>STARTERS<br/>* Vegan Fresh Rolls ($9.95) - 3.5 stars<br/>Good! A light starter. Not super memorable.<br/><br/>* Kobe Beef Jerky ($12) - 4 stars<br/>Interesting, crunchy, full of flavor. Not for everyone, but I liked it! <br/><br/>* Neua Num Tok Rolls ($14) - 4.5 stars<br/>Incredibly soft, tender meat!<br/><br/>SPECIAL<br/>* Thai Street Green Curry Noodles ($17.95) - 3.5 stars<br/>Love the curry flavor, but chicken was a bit dry, vermicelli stuck together. I really wanted this to work together, and the components really do, but they just gotta fix those little things. <br/><br/>* Hat Yai Fried Chicken ($18.95) - 4 stars<br/>Very juicy, excellent fried chicken! Great with the curry.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">We came on a Saturday night to a busy restaurant with party vibes from a first glimpse. When we were dropped off, we were surprised to see that Farmhouse was the restaurant on the street with loud music, bold colors, and workers wearing elaborate costumes; this is definitely not your typical Thai food spot or Thai food take out restaurant. <br/><br/>I had made a reservation at 6:30, but they were kind enough to extend my reservation to 6:40, since we were running late. When at the door, we were instantly greeted by a hostess who was dressed in a Thai-themed costume; he really added to the theme and festivities of the restaurant. <br/><br/>After being seated, we were served pickled cabbages and carrots, which I actually really enjoyed since they were refreshing. For an appetizer, we decided on the samosa. The order came with three samosas and a yellow curry dipping sauce. The samosas were super flaky on the outside and moist from the potatoes on the inside. The curry sauce was also one the best I have yet to have! It was super aromatic and lightly sweetened. For our entrees, we ordered the river prawn pad thai and the curried shrimp dish that came with blue rice. The dishes came on large and beautiful plates, but I was honestly not super impressed by the food. The pad thai was good, but definitely not the best I have had. For my personal preference, I wish they used more tamarind sauce or sauce in general, since the noodles came out pretty pale in color, even though they should be well coated in sauce. Also, the pad thai was $23, which I thought was a bit ridiculous for a dish that should be super inexpensive. The pad prawns were good and juicy, but super greasy; the whole dish was swimming in oil. However, I did really enjoy the blue rice. We decided to try a dessert so we went for the Thai vacation, which I enjoyed as well! It was a coconut ice cream and sticky rice combination that paired well.<br/><br/>The ambiance at the restaurant was amazing! It was super festive and the decorations were so colorful. Also, halfway through the dinner, waitresses were walking around with food on shoulder baskets to give an even more authentic Thai feeling. <br/><br/>I do wish the restaurant wasn\\'t as loud as it was, however. The blasting music made conversations somewhat difficult. Also, the prices are honestly really steep for this place; each entree was about $20-23, and though good, I think it\\'s a bit excessive to spend that much for Thai food that isn\\'t even that amazing. <br/><br/>Overall, the food was a 3.5/5, but since the ambiance was so amazing, I am rounding it to a 4. I would come back again for the experience and the ambiance, but I am sure there are better Thai restaurants.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">I\\'d say that here is the best Sai-uua (Northern Thai\\'s sausage) in the bay! Plus if u have w/ sticky rice OMG, hella yummm(the main reason why i rate them 5 stars). Also Meang-kum w/ fried shrimps, even it was not Thai traditional style but its taste still remind me about The dish.<br/><br/>They offered us some fried grasshopper as well, so weird but i taste nothing.<br/><br/>Coconut ice cream which they called yim yim something was not worth they should add more sticky rice, corn , beans or something that represent more Thai fresh coconut ice cream style, quite disappointed but \\xa0btw its taste was good. <br/><br/>Mok Salmon was a little bit over-cooked but over all was good. It came wt a huge piece of salmon.<br/><br/>I do like their creativity and the way they present Thai culture via their dishes and the decoration. I\\'m so delightful to see my root-culture in the way they represent.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">My wonderful friend took me here to Farmhouse Kitchen to experience some amazing Thai fusion cuisine. Super super busy but luckily Yelp Reservations made it easy for three of us to dine without worrying about having to wait for a table. <br/><br/>I was intrigued by the concept of this restaurant, and in particular one dish that was described as a must try: the Hat Yai fried chicken. I have to say this dish was pretty interesting. On one hand you have this delicious curry which is complemented by some blue rice. On the other side you have this amazingly crispy fried chicken with this delicious sauce. The chicken is really well done though - when you bite into it is moist and soft but the outside is nice and crisp. Top it off with some naan bread on the side and you got a full meal. <br/><br/>For $19.50, this meal can seem like it costs a lot, but I can assure you that its worth every cent. Because the portion is pretty big, I\\'m not sure that most people actually can finish it. I must be an exception to the rule however because this meal was so delicious I couldn\\'t let it go to waste. Overall, a great restaurant in Mission District, this one will definitely be on my radar whenever I\\'m in the neighbourhood.</p>',\n",

       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Awesome food!! You know an asian restaurant is authentic when they don\\'t water down the flavors of the food. We ordered the papaya salad with fermented fish sauce and it was good! (The stinker, the better) They even have a fermented crab sauce option. Came in for my bestie\\'s grad. dinner on Monday night &amp; the place was quite busy (maybe it was graduation night too?). Aside from the papaya salad, we also ordered the sausage, beef salad, &amp; roasted pork belly. The beef salad was so tasty as the sauce had a savory, vinegary flavor and the beef was tender. I\\'m usually not a fan of roasted pork belly but this dish was an exception - they seasoned it with a chilly powder along with roasted rice powder. <br/><br/>The ambiance of the place was casual. At first, it didn\\'t look like a thai restaurant until you walk in where the employees are dressed in traditional clothing along with the decor. Service was friendly with food coming out accordingly and servers were always on top of water refills. Based on other yelp reviews, parking can be a hassle as there are limited parking in the busy streets, so we\\'ve decided to uber here. Overall food was delicious &amp; service was awesome - will come back when in SF.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Came here with a group of ten last week and was super pleased with the experience and food! This place is definitely Michelin rated for a reason! We put our name down around 7:30 and waited 30-45 minutes to be seated (not bad given our group size). They\\'re nice enough to call you when your table is ready, so you can roam around the area (Trick Dog hello!) while you wait. <br/><br/>To start we all shared the Tom Kha soup with chicken. It came in a flame pot to keep it constantly warm and it was dynamite! The chicken was shredded and cooked well and the soup itself had very rich flavor - on the sweeter side as far as Tom Kha soups go, with good balance established with the cilantro. Pretty sizeable portion given 10 of us all had a bowl with some to spare.<br/><br/>For mains I had the Papaya Salad and the Red Curry. Okay so the Papaya Salad was easily the BEST Papaya Salad I\\'ve ever had, and I pretty much thrive on Thai food. Fair warning - this dish is spicy! But in the best way possible if you can handle it. It had a great crunch from the peanuts and chewy dried shrimp. Just an explosion of flavors and textures in your mouth. Would highly recommend for those not afraid of spice.<br/><br/>The Red Curry was equally fantastic. It had a rich flavor just like the soup with lots of basil and actually came in a great portion size. We ordered the blue rice to accompany it. To me it didn\\'t taste special but hey, it\\'s blue and that\\'s perty cool. <br/><br/>Ambiance is very comforting and warm! The decor is awesome - you\\'ll be sure to notice the faucets on the wall. <br/><br/>Farmhouse is just a fantastic place to come for a satisfying meal in a warm environment. :)</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">SOOO GOOD and spicy like I LIKE IT. It\\'s very rare that I say this but THIS PLACE IS SOOOOO WORTH THE WAIT. <br/><br/>Swung by on a Sunday after doing an event with my company nearby on Mission. It was kind of early for dinner (around 5), but this place was paaaacked. The wait was 40 minutes, but even though we were hangry we decided to just go with it and grab drinks while we waited. We ended up getting to the bar and being confused, but finally ordering a COCO-LADA, a drink with coconut cream and a bunch of other goodness. Refreshing and a good way to calm the hangry nerves.<br/><br/>After finally getting sat at about 50 minutes, we were famished. The server came by quickly and grabbed our drinks. We started with a large TOM YUM soup which came out slowly, but was suuuper tasty. BE WARNED, this soup is Thai spicy, not commonplace spicy. About 10 or so minutes after the soup came out the entrees were sent. We got the EPIC FRIED CHICKEN and the special they had that night called the LARB MOO. The chicken was easily some of the best fried chicken I\\'ve had in the city with a great crispy outside and tender inside. It was juicy and just had an overall great taste. The Larb was actually just a salad kind of dish with a side of sticky rice. It also was good, but again the spice level here is on the high side. I might pass on this one next time, but loved how it came as an assortment of goods. <br/><br/>Loved the professional attitude and overall positive vibes here. Def coming back!</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Some of the most delicious samosas I\\'ve ever had! I ordered the yellow Tofu curry as my main entree. With the side roti, blue rice and the big bowl of curry, the entree was A LOT of food. I could hardly eat it all, and almost wish I had known how big the portions would be so I could split it. <br/><br/>Not the most vegeterain-friendly Thai though. Originally I had planned on ordering the Papaya salad, something a little less hearty and rich than curry, but was told the dressing used wasn\\'t vegetarian and that there was no way to alter this dish to make it vegetarian. Kind of a disappointment and slightly annoying since Papaya salads are normally a veggie go-to (and how hard is it to just not add dressing to a salad?)<br/><br/>The ambiance of the restaurant is dressy, lively, not too noisy, low-lighting, hipster-Thai fusion fun. I went here for my birthday and would recommend this place for special occasions!</p>',\n",

However, the lunch crowd started to trickle in after we sat down and got pretty busy by around 12:30 or so. <br/><br/>My friend and I shared the samosas and pad Thai for lunch. Both were really good! The Samosas came in 3s and was deep fried. It was on the oily side but that was partly also what made it taste good. My only complaint about the samosa was that the crust was nice and hot but the inside was actually not very warm. It would\\'ve been nice if the temperature was more even. The pad Thai was good but a bit smaller portion than what I\\'m used to. Overall the food and service were good!</p>',\n",

I recommend dinner over lunch because the ambiance is more unique at dinnertime.<br/> <br/>AMBIANCE/DECOR<br/>Loud Thai music/songs playing and staff dressed in Thai cultural clothing at dinner time vs no music and staff dressed in t-shirts during lunch time. The place is cute and interestingly decorated, from a wall of faucets to the antique sewing machine at the hostess/check-in station. Each table has a small succulent plant.<br/> <br/>FOOD<br/>Most memorable items I\\'ve had were the shrimp/prawn appetizer, fried calamari (it\\'s not your usual calamari), short ribs (very tender and flavorful), Mary\\'s chicken, and samosas (also like the curry sauce it comes with). They have specials that they print out on small cards.<br/> <br/>SERVICE<br/>Good service with each experience, still feel dinner service is a bit better. Food comes out fairly fast and they never took my order wrong. They take reservations for large parties in advance. Usually a wait for dinner, but usually no wait at lunch.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Farmhouse Kitchen in the outskirts of the Mission District is undoubtedly one of the most beautifully and colorfully-decorated restaurants I\\'ve ever visited. Inside, there are colorful flags and art all over, as well as antiques that make you feel like you stepped back in time and into the opposite side of the world! Above all, however, the waiters were super friendly (and were all wearing water guns strapped to their shoulders--apparently in honor of a New Years festival/tradition that happens in Thailand) and the food absolutely amazing!<br/><br/>I came for lunch with a group of four, but the portion sizes are quite big, so we ordered three main dishes to share, and it was more than enough! The Kai Yang, Som Tum plate came with the most tender barbecue chicken I\\'ve ever had (marinated in turmeric and coconut), along with a bamboo steamer of chewy sticky rice, a dish of spicy, pungent papaya salad, and a vinegary spicy sauce for dipping. What an amazing, perfectly balanced combination! <br/><br/>The Thai Street Green Curry Noodles were also amazing--the delicious, fragrant curry came with chunks of bone-in dark meat chicken and plenty of vegetables including eggplant, bell pepper, and bamboo. But the most amazing part of the curry was that you could taste the depth and variety of herbs that were used--so fresh, fragrant, and complex! The dish was served with rice noodles, bean sprouts, and pickled veggies on the side for a great combination.<br/><br/>However, the dish that impressed me the most in terms of flavor was actually one of the most simple--the Mok Salmon, which consisted of grilled wild salmon wrapped in a banana leaf with oyster mushroom, and served with grilled asparagus, blue rice, and a spicy cilantro lime sauce. The best part of the dish was definitely the salmon. Like the other dishes we had, you could really taste all of the pungent herbs and spices that were cooked with the salmon--the depth and level of the flavors were unbelievable, yet the salmon wasn\\'t overpowered at all! The blue rice was also particularly fragrant (though I have no idea how they make this!), and the spicy cilantro sauce went perfectly with every component of this dish.<br/><br/>Farmhouse Kitchen deserves 5+ stars for the finesse of their dishes--not only is the plating absolutely beautiful, but the execution is unparalleled, and every single dish I tried was perfectly seasoned, and the components were perfectly well-balanced. I\\'ll be back!!</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Celebrated Father\\'s Day here yesterday with a dinner reservation for seven. It was easy to find parking since there seemed to be more availability with the ninety degree parking around the area. It was also a pretty hot day for SF and even though we were seated right by the open doorway, it was really really hot inside the restaurant. I couldn\\'t imagine how I would\\'ve felt like sitting further into the restaurant.. there was absolutely no breeze coming inside. That was probably one of my main issues with this restaurant - the lack of ventilation and fresh air! <br/><br/>Here are some of the things my family and I ordered. For appetizers, we started off with their samosas, calamari, and mieng kum kung (crispy tiger prawns). I didn\\'t have a chance to try the samosas. The calamari was good, but I wasn\\'t expecting the batter to be so thick/deep fried. It looked like onion rings you\\'d get out of the fair.. The pickled vegetables they served at the beginning of our meal were so good!<br/><br/>Most of our dishes had blue rice which was pretty unique. My mom ordered the mok salmon which was wrapped in a banana leaf. I took a bite of this and I wasn\\'t too big of a fan of the taste. It definitely had the taste of the banana leaf.. but it was a huge piece of salmon! My boyfriend and I got their hat yai fried chicken. If you\\'re looking for a comparison with what it tasted like, I\\'d say the fried chicken plate at King of Thai! But this dish comes with roti bread and yellow curry for dipping! My dad got their tiger prawn pad thai. Pad thai is always good, but my dad said the tiger prawns didn\\'t have much meat. My brother got chicken yellow curry which tasted pretty standard. My sister\\'s boyfriend had the kang kua prawns which seemed to be a very small portion. My sister got one of their seafood specials and I\\'m not sure if it was the phi pi platter.. but it wasn\\'t good. It came with an assortment of seafood like mussels, tiger prawns, octopus, some sea shell.. lol. The vermicelli noodles served in the middle of the dish were difficult to separate and had absolutely no flavor. Her dish actually took forever to come out and sadly it was not worth the wait.<br/><br/>Another issue I had with this place was the fact that they kept waiting on us to pick up our plates at almost every opportunity. Yes, I get it, you wanna clear up the table, but I felt like it made our dinner feel a little rushed. At several points during our dinner, when we\\'d just be sitting there, I\\'d notice the waiters/waitresses just standing there like \"Are you done?\" <br/><br/>A little on the pricier side of Thai cuisine, but I\\'d say it\\'s worth a try. They gotta do something with the ventilation though..</p>',\n",

Menu claims that the fish is \"wild caught\" salmon yet I was served an enormous piece of farmed fish that tasted worse than something you would pick up at the Whole Foods hot bar. Chicken wings were nothing special. Ahi cups were nothing special, just spicy. Beef noodle soup was outrageously priced at $23. Prices are astronomical for the lousy quality of food. I was incorrectly misled by the glowing Yelp reviews and would never recommend this restaurant to anyone.</p>',\n",

I \\xa0wish I had taken more than just the photo of my own dish but I spent my efforts stuffing my face and I forget to take pictures of the environment and my husband\\'s and kids\\' plates. My husband selected a mango salad that he thouroughly enjoyed (advance notice that it smells a bit like stinky feet, which scared him at first). Our eldest enjoyed the red curry plate and was actually full despite the initial feeling that it would perhaps not be enough. Our 11 and 7 year olds shared a chicken noodle soup. They were like revenous beasts they enjoyed it so!<br/><br/>Overall a very pleasant experience of \\xa0delicious \\xa0and \\xa0fresh food, excellent hospitality and a great atmosphere.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Incredibly authentic and amazing! Thai vibes with awesome customer service. <br/><br/>We ordered a lot of food, but I solely remembered my 24 hour beef bone! Must get here! Despite the price, I think it\\'s worth trying this place. The servers are super friendly and they also do a special birthday celebration if you dine here for your birthday.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">4.5/5. Some of the best Thai food I\\'ve ever had and such a fun atmosphere/decor! Definitely a very authentic Thai experience, with a very enthusiastic host to add to the vibe. I would recommend making a reservation as most of the 6:30-8pm restaurant times get taken. I did arrive on time for my reservation, but still had to wait about 15 minutes before I got seated. However, the servers were so kind as to give me a free desert for the wait, even though I really didn\\'t wait that long! It really shows that Farmhouse appreciates their patrons and want us to have the best experience. <br/><br/>[Dinner]<br/>I ordered the 24 hour beef noodle soup. The give you A LOT of meat and the soup was extremely flavorful. It seems that this is a highlight for the restaurant and I would definitely come back for this dish! My friend ordered the yellow curry. It was alright, I wasn\\'t super impressed with the curry or the hyped up purple rice (even though it was really pretty to take pictures of). <br/><br/>[Drinks]<br/>Highly recommend the fresh coconut. I really like coconut water, and they top off the whole nut to the brim and bring it out with a spoon so you can scoop the meat out after. I want to come back and try the beautiful cocktails.<br/><br/>[Decor]<br/>I think 50% of the reason to dine here is definitely to see the work of art that is the inside.<br/><br/>Overall, definitely a must-try if you enjoy authentic experiences. I\\'ll definitely be back for the 24 hours beef noodle soup!</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Came here for my friend\\'s birthday a few months ago and was super impressed! She chose the place and made reservations, so the wait wasn\\'t long at all.<br/><br/>The ambiance is super cool, very trendy, with the waiters/waitresses all wearing brightly colored Hawaiian shirts. It\\'s pretty loud in the dinner room, so maybe not the best choice if you\\'re trying to have a quiet intimate conversation.<br/><br/>I got the Thai Style Fried Chicken, which came with rice, yellow curry, and roti. I was impressed with how big the portion was, and also thankful because I was so hungry! The dish was super flavorful, and I loved having the warm curry to dip everything in. I didn\\'t get to try anyone else\\'s dishes, but honestly I was so impressed with mine I will totally come back just for that. <br/><br/>Only thing I wasn\\'t a huge fan of were the prices, $10-15 for an appetizer and $20-25 for a main dish was kind of steep, so this isn\\'t somewhere I would want to put up the cash to frequent. However for a special occasion it\\'s a fun dining experience and somewhere I\\'d recommend everyone trying at least once!</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Wow, I can\\'t believe I haven\\'t reviewed this place yet- it\\'s definitely one of my neighborhood go-to spots. Great thai food and great service- it\\'s a bit pricier than your normal thai joint but you can tell that they take great care to try to make the food as good as possible.<br/><br/>Whatever you do, DO NOT bypass the short rib on your trip here. It\\'s fall off the bone goodness paired with blue rice that you don\\'t want to miss. The fried chicken is one of their famous dishes and it doesn\\'t disappoint either. I\\'m not sure what\\'s better honestly- the chicken, or the roti and dipping sauce that comes with the dish. I\\'ve asked for the sauce by itself a few times with no shame because it\\'s that good.<br/><br/>For starters, skip the vegan fresh rolls- the wrapper is weirdly thick and not tasty. However, an order of the Neua Num Tok Rolls and Mieng Kum Kung prawns are well worth your time. The Tok Rolls are grilled and marinated flank steak wrapped up with cilantro and a cilantro lime dressing- really fresh and refreshing. The prawns are coconut battered and fried and also amazing.<br/><br/>I\\'ve had some of their curries here as well, which have always been good- but watch out if you don\\'t want bones in to make sure you order the right curry!<br/><br/>BYO is $20 a bottle if you choose to go that route. There isn\\'t a full bar, but they do have beer and wine!</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Came for lunch on a Saturday and didn\\'t have to wait at all. Was seated right away and service was consistently good throughout the meal as they checked in a couple of times. We ordered the pad Thai, pad see ew, Thai fried rice, and a curry from the special (with slow roasted beef? Can\\'t remember what it is called, sorry!) and Thai iced teas. I would recommend the pad Thai and Thai fried rice, but all of the meat in our dishes was a bit dry. The Thai iced tea wasn\\'t really worth the $5 price point as well and it was quite sweet. The serving sizes were on the smaller size. Service wise, they are great! Food wise, they are okay.</p>',\n",

       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Food: I guess somehow it had one of the most expensive bowl of noodles I\\'ve ever had. 24 hr beef noodle soup. The noodles were decent but very small amount. Egg noodle. I\\'d be happy paying 15 to 16 bucks. But wow 23? It is a giant bone in short rib. Maybe that\\'s why it\\'s so pricey. But when all is said and done out the door with tip is 29 dollars for a lunch for 1 person. Hmmm. It\\'s not so so so good that I think a bowl of noodle soup is worth that. <br/><br/>I don\\'t think I\\'d come back. It was busy though tons of people. The rest of the food seemed to be priced more normally. It\\'s pretty trendy. Want to seem like street stall except you are paying hell of a lot more for it. Didn\\'t really feel like a place I\\'d come back to. Like just a little too much for me.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">***MORE LIKE A 3.5*** <br/><br/>My sister and brother in law put it on hella thick that this spot was going to be good and it was the \"best\" Thai spot they\\'ve been to out in the Bay so I had to try it! They also said everything they had was HELLA good. With that said, I ordered a variety of things off the menu and I can\\'t say I had the same experience. <br/><br/>First impression, I liked their little hidden location. I thought the place itself was hella cute and decorated fun. I wanted to take that flower pot/center piece home lol but I took a picture of it instead. The service was like other people have said it was so-so. I didn\\'t think they were hella friendly and they weren\\'t hella rude BUT I did feel rushed towards the end when hella people started lining up outside the doors. Luckily, because it was planned I set up reservations around 6 PM this past Sunday so it wasn\\'t hella busy when we first came in. Also, I don\\'t know if I was just distracted but I was surprised at how fast everything came out. <br/><br/>As for the food, I listed what we ordered and my personal opinion: <br/><br/>STARTERS <br/>- Ahi scoops: hella cute to look at &amp; tasted just as good too, the fish was fresh, the flavor had a little kick to it, know that they only come with 4 servings though <br/>- Thai fish cakes: this wasn\\'t anything extraordinary but it wasn\\'t bad, I think this came with 6 cakes and crispies underneath <br/>- Kobe beef jerky: I know it\\'s supposed to be jerky but I thought it was a little too dry LOL, either that or it really didn\\'t have any flavor it was more something to chew on but it is good with the lime-y sauce <br/>- Mieng Kum Kung: unfortunately didn\\'t get to try this because it\\'s my sisters favorite thing from this spot lol and everyone ate it all, there wasn\\'t enough to serve our table so order appropriately lol <br/><br/>SPECIAL <br/>- Mok salmon: I like how they wrapped it with the fresh dill on top added a LITTLE flavor, and they didn\\'t overcook the salmon, it is better with the green sauce which I am assuming is something cilantro-lime-y <br/>- Panang neua: the best thing here according to my sister and brother in law, I agree there is a lot of flavor, sweeter than I am used to but still hella good! The meat falls right off the bone <br/>- Hat Yai fried chicken: the \"other\" best thing, again I lucked out trying this one but I did try the dipping sauce and again, lots of flavor and if you like your curry sweet it\\'s good. <br/><br/>THAI STREET FOOD <br/>- Pad See You: My family ordered this last minute so I was too stuffed to try it. My brother said it was the best he had because he could tell the noodles were fresh and prepared there <br/><br/>SOUP<br/>- Tom yum: one of the main reasons I had to knock them down some, this arrived fast but HELLA cold like nobody wants cold soup (well at my table anyway) and on top of that the spoon they gave me was hella too big to scoop stuff out, there wasn\\'t enough broth to serve to everyone at my table, the flavor was good extra tangy and spicy which I liked but don\\'t expect more than 6 prawns, I prefer more of a seafood combination option <br/><br/>SALAD <br/>- Yum Moo Krob: I thought \"garden vegetables\" was going to be more like a typical salad but it was just pork belly on top of hard cabbage with a sauce similar to what they put on the larb. I was disappointed this didn\\'t taste as good as I hoped. To be honest, there was no crunch to the pork belly it was either prepared with too much moisture or it was sitting out for a while. It hurt my teeth to eat this lol. You know it\\'s not crispy enough when the skin is like sticking to your teeth. My brother in law can cook a mean piece of lechon though, which I think most prefer crispy. <br/><br/>SIDES <br/>- Side of asparagus: I liked this, not overcooked, still crispy, and who doesn\\'t like garlic? <br/>- Side of bone broth: I don\\'t know why I expected more from this lol but it was simple, not bad, kind of what you would get if you ordered broth at a pho restaurant <br/><br/>DESSERT <br/>Platter: Enough to feed our table lol, variety of things to choose from &amp; again cute <br/><br/>Overall, I didn\\'t hate it but I think my sister made me set high expectations. I think it would have been different if we didn\\'t feel rushed and the soup was actually hot. I would come back and try the things I missed! Everything is definitely overpriced tho!</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Food 4/5. Service 5/5. Ambiance 4/5. Bang for your buck 4/5. <br/><br/>A little off the beaten path (literally, it\\'s kinda hard to get too unless you Uber/Lyft), Farmhouse is a refreshing thai place that doesn\\'t do typical thai dishes. In a way it\\'s thai fusion spin that somehow keeps the flavor very authentic and rich. <br/><br/>The atmosphere and service is great. The staff members are very attentive and always willing to help. One of the dishes was too spicy, and they were nice enough to take it back and remake it. For the price, the entrees are well proportion for a thai place in San Fransisco (almost too much food). <br/><br/>The dish I got was the Hat Yai Chicken which consists of a fried chicken, yellow curry with potatoes, roti, and blue jasmine rice. It was delicious as the roti went delicious with the yellow curry. The blue jasmine rice was fragrant and went great with the yellow curry as well. The fried chicken was golden brown and delicious as well but I only wished that the chicken was a little bit crispier (not as crispy as I would hope). <br/><br/>Overall, this restaurant is great and is well worth the trek, however, I always leave feeling something was missing from my thai experience (I have yet to figure out what it is, but It\\'s pretty minor). <br/><br/>Tips - Get the fried chicken! If you are feeling for some noodles get the boat noodles, you won\\'t regret it. <br/><br/>Pros - the portions are great with high quality food. <br/><br/>Cons - Out of the way to get too!</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Celebrated my best friend\\'s birthday here last Sunday. I have been wanting to try this place specifically for 2 things. One, because of how they greet the birthday celebrant before serving dessert and two, to try their bomb Hat Yai chicken. We started with some appetizers; Ahi tuna scoops, crispy tiger prawns, and calamari. (All freakin delicious) For entrees; most of us got yellow curry and Hat Yai Friend Chicken. (I definitely recommend trying the Hat Yai) Highlight of this dining experience: Pad See You dinner with crispy pork belly (we ordered 1 to share). TO DIE FOR. If I had to choose 1 dish from the menu, I\\'d definitely pick that. <br/><br/>I am only giving them 4 stars because although the service was pretty fast, they messed up our order, had us cut our own cake and gave us insufficient utensils and plate.</p>',\n",

We got the 24hr beef noodle soup medium spicy, and it definitely has a kick. The hat yai fried chicken was greaaaaat (crunchy outside, blue rice o.o, love the sauce) and the pad see ew with pork belly was delicious (the pork belly really sticks to your teeth though).

       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Fairly legit Thai food in the Mission with a reasonable price and nice ambiance. I\\'ve gone for group lunches here and the lunch menu is a tasty food and generous portion size at good price. I like the balanced flavor profile and fresh spices of the food - doesn\\'t rely on sugar or oil as poor Thai food does.<br/><br/>During lunchtime, the service is fairly efficient and attentive. They\\'ve never gotten my order wrong and the worst wait hasn\\'t been that bad even when the place is at capacity. The ambiance and presentation are semi-bougie - bright colors, nostalgic surf rock music, a single table with plastic lawn chairs and tablecloth. Side note, the bathroom is clean and pleasant.<br/><br/>Tom Kha with Chicken - Sour, bright and citrusy kaffir lime flavor, coconut milk is savory but not too much or heavy. The consistency was still watery and not super rich or thick like curry, a good thing.<br/>Beef Salad - Slightly sweet and sour marinade, acidic dressing, fresh fibrous greens. Texture was like a chewy soft like bak kwa pork jerky.<br/>Green Curry Chicken - A good sized portion for lunch. Only mildly spicy and a fairly thin, not soupy curry which I like. Very fragrant with bamboo shoots, basil. Had it with Jasmine rice.</p>',\n",

They also have tasty cocktails and are a great place for a group dinner/hangout!<br/><br/>My favorite by far is probably the Hat Yai Fried Chicken, and this entree comes with SO MUCH FOOD. In addition to a super crispy and delicious fried chicken, you get some curry and rice to pair it with. The Ahi Tuna scoops are also a great appetizer, but spicier than I expected! If it\\'s your birthday, come here to celebrate and the staff will come to your table to sing (with props).<br/><br/>The service is pretty fast so turnover is good if you\\'re coming here for a bite with no reservation!</p>',\n",

I love the open kitchen and the restaurant space.<br/><br/>Like many other Thai restaurants, the menu is pretty big. Everything that I have tried so far is pretty good and tasty. My favorites from the appetizers were the Thai fish cake and the Neua num tok rolls. The fish cake was very fragrant with the fresh kaffir lime leaves, and the rolls were so delicious... it\\'s basically rolled grilled flank steak with mint, cilantro and cucumber which came with a tangy dipping sauce... yum!<br/><br/>For the main course, I had enjoyed the BBQ chicken served with papaya salad; the hat yai fried chicken served with potato yellow curry; and the short rib panang neua. All dishes were cooked nicely, and the portion was pretty big and ideal for sharing. The seasoning and spice level were spot on, and the ingredients tasted fresh.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">New favorite Thai restaurant!! I\\'m not usually a huge fan of Thai - I\\'ll eat it but I never crave it. But this place was so good, and that\\'s saying something for expensive thai food.. <br/><br/>The 24 hour beef soup is pretty strong, so if you\\'re not a fan of super strong broths and flavors, I\\'d stay away. It\\'s super flavorful. The pad see yew with pork belly was also deliciousss and the pork belly is perfectly soft and crispy. Just crispy enough to add some texture to the chewy noodles! But by far, the best is the hat yai fried chicken. Seriously, I cannot rave about this chicken enough. What everyone is saying is true - it\\'s so crispy and juicy and tender, and the blue rice + curry are perfect with it. I got the thai iced tea (which I also don\\'t normally like) for dessert which was pretty good! I\\'m not a thai tea expert, but I really appreciated that they could make it with soy milk (yay for non-dairy options).<br/><br/>I will be CRAVING this thai food now.</p>',\n",

       "  '<p lang=\"en\">TYPICAL TASTING THAI FOOD<br/>(3.5 stars)<br/><br/>Just so you know... on yelp RSVP it said no opening until 5pm. However, at 3pm I was able to walk-in and get a table for 3. <br/><br/>I wanted to like this place but I need to expect more than average tasting food. I guess restaurants in SF are doing new things to be \"creative\" to stand out in the crowd. Well, I\\'ll be real with you - typical tasting thai food, nice presentation, but nothing to over bend the wallet. I don\\'t get the concept of \"farmhouse\" and \"thai food\". The ambiance was cute and clean but walking in didn\\'t feel like I was a Thai restaurant. For example, you can uproot the thai restaurant and put an American(New) restaurant and the owner wouldn\\'t have to change the decor. <br/><br/>1. Servers were thai, food was authentic <br/>2. Service was good<br/>3. Menu had a decent selection <br/>4. Food was good<br/>5. Price wasn\\'t worth it<br/>6. Try not to sit near the back wall. Why? Because it\\'s near the one toilet unisex bathroom. And someone took a dump and the staff cracked the door and it smelt like shit. That\\'s so gross, luckily we were done eating but that\\'s just disgusting. <br/><br/>NEUN NAM TOK ROLLS - it\\'s basically cucumber, cilantro, and mint rolled up in meat. It was tasty but a little overrated. Average. And average shouldn\\'t be expensive. The meat wasn\\'t as tender as I\\'d expect it for the price you pay. <br/><br/>GREEN CURRY - with pork belly. Pork belly for the choice of meat was the best choice. They were bite size and crispy. But it would have been nice if they warned you this was spicy. Not just spicy but \\'thai\\' spicy. I could only handle one bite but that one bite was good. for those with sensitive stomach... be ware, it made my stomach lightly twist throughout 24hrs. RECOMMEND if you like spicy curry.<br/><br/>GRILLED RIVER PRAWNS PAD THAI - this is from the special menu and not the regular pad Thai listed on the back of the menu. This special pad Thai is $8 difference. And honestly, nothing is special about it. Same Pad Thai with fried wontons and ONE big prawn cut in half (not plural prawnS) on top as garnish. No choice of meat, by default tofu is mixed in. It was good/decent/typical tasting Pad Thai but if you don\\'t care for those garnishes save yourself $8 and get the regular pad Thai. RECOMMEND if you want to pricy Pad thai. <br/><br/>PAD FRESH GINGER SAUCE - with chicken, shiitake mushrooms, white onion, green onion, and fresh ginger. LOL the name is ridiculous. Obviously they are Americanizing their menu but they should keep it authentic with the names, this is basically Gai Pad King. This was very good, but again typical tasting. RECOMMEND.<br/><br/>SLATE BLUE/GRAY RICE - nothing special. Don\\'t be fooled. It\\'s just presentation. They cook rice with butterfly pea flower but it didn\\'t change the the taste of the rice JUST THE COLOR. <br/><br/>BUTTERFLY PEA FLOWER DRINK - not listed on their menu. But when the server mentioned how they prepared the rice, I recall having A butterfly pea flower drink in a different thai restaurant. Thy prepared it on my request and it wasn\\'t as great as I had it before. It was like a sweet/sour lightly carbonated lemonade. Def not how I\\'ve had it before and was kind of disappointed.<br/><br/>Nice ambiance, good food, but not a rush to come back. <br/><br/>Until the next review...</p>',\n",

Not only is the food delicious, the decor and atmosphere makes you feel like you\\'re on a vacation in Thailand.<br/><br/>We got the fried chicken plate, 24 hour beef noodle soup, and Thai Vacation for dessert. Everything blew my mind away. I could taste authenticity, real ingredients, and lots of flavor in all their dishes. Highly recommend.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">We came here for our first meal after landing in San Francisco. One of my friends highly recommended it. It is located in the Mission area of SF. We walked in during lunch hour and it was packed.<br/><br/>AMBIENCE: The ambience was amazing. The restaurant is filled with an array of inviting colors, patterns, and textures. The music was fun and soothing. They did a good job in depicting some of the Thai culture in their design. Everyone seemed to be in good spirits and enjoying themselves.<br/><br/>FOOD: We dined as a group of (3) and did family style in order to try as much as we can. We got the Kobe Beef Jerky, Chicken Wing (4 wings), Mok Salmon, Thai Street Green Curry Noodles, Kai Yang Som Tum, Iced Coffee Thai Way, and Honey Milk Lavender. The food was spot on! The portions are fairly large, so be mindful about that. The presentation of each dish was beautiful and creative. There was so much flavor packed in each bite but was not too overpowering. I liked how they put the sauces on the side - that way you had control over how spicy you wanted each bite to be. Overall, I would say the food was pretty authentic to traditional Thai style cuisine. <br/><br/>SERVICE: The staff was busting their butts and moving quickly. We were seated fairly quickly but it took 10-15 minutes before anyone approached our table. Other than the initial long wait for our order to be placed, the experience after that was nothing short of fantastic. The staff was very friendly and attentive. I would definitely recommend trying this place out. We look forward to returning again!</p>',\n",

But it tastes good like it mixes with vinegar and sugar.. something like that with shredded carrots! Comes with delicious fried chicken with Thai roti... yummm. and the curry! OMG BOMB.COM! <br/>-LARP, comes with sticky rice inside the a mini enclosure that\\'s like made out of bamboo!

Succulent plants everywhere from the tables to the outside of the restaurant. Walked in on a Wednesday night with no reservations and was lucky enough to get seated in five minutes. We got served some pickled vegetables as a free starter.<br/><br/>PAPAYA SALAD $12.50<br/>A good light option to combat the fried chicken that followed after. The medium spicy wasn\\'t really spicy at all. I probably won\\'t get this next time and would opt to try the mango salad or herbed rice salad next time. <br/><br/>HAT YAI FRIED CHICKEN $18.95<br/>Stellar! Fried chicken is perfectly crispy and it just flakes off easily. Biting into it, the crispy part reminds me of funnel cake. Chicken breast is nice and juicy and it pairs well with either the sweet and sour sauce that comes on the side or you can dip it in the curry. The dish also comes with roti, curry dip with potatoes, blue rice, and some pickled side veggies all on one big tray.<br/><br/>After we finished eating, they cleared our dishes and then someone came and set out new plates in front of us and that was confusing since we hadn\\'t even received our check yet. I thought more food was coming or something (that we didn\\'t order) since they gave us new plates but I guess they were just setting it up early?</p>',\n",

We got attention from multiple people that were checking in to make sure we had everything we needed and were happy. The waiters made a point of walking around the establishment looking around at people\\'s tables in intervals. I haven\\'t seen that kind of dedication in a long time at a SF restaurant. <br/><br/>Secondly the food was delicious. We ordered:<br/><br/>Par Dip Fresh Tuna <br/>Pretty spicy. Actually a great pairing with the Tom Kha soup since it helped with the spice level. Really tasty. <br/><br/>Crab Fried Rice <br/>They dished out a lot of crab in this dish which I appreciated. The dish came with some sort of beef broth which I think were suppose to use for more flavoring? The crab fried rice was excellent on it\\'s own. <br/><br/>Large Tom Kha <br/>LOVED this. Best Tom Kha I have ever had. Amazing base broth. We ask them to add shrimp in it. Highly recommend you do the same. Definitely order the large if you are sharing this with two people. You will probably need to get two larges if you are sharing with more than two people. <br/><br/>Glass of the Waterwall Pino-yum <br/><br/>Presentation was on point for all three dishes.<br/><br/>The whole vibe of the place is happy. Also this is a great place to take groups. They had some huge farmhouse style table set ups that could of accommodated a group of 10 or more. <br/><br/>I\\'ll be back.</p>',\n",

       "  '<p lang=\"en\">I have mixed feelings for this restaurant - my coworkers and I used to frequent this place for lunch whenever we wanted to have a \"treat yourself\" day (about 3-4 times a month). The food is excellent, but when I went a few months ago they had raised prices of (their already expensive) dishes by $1-$2. It doesn\\'t look like the price increase has been reflected in the lunch menu on yelp (you\\'ve been warned). Although the food is very good my coworkers and I now go only once every few months which is a shame since we\\'re only a few blocks away. Average per person after tax, tip and health fee is around $22-$27. Too pricey for lunch out in this area.<br/><br/>For those who do want to treat themselves, make sure to check out some of my favorite dishes:<br/>* 24 Hours Beef Noodle Soup - a favorite when it\\'s cold out, I ask for it with no spice - the meat is tender and falls off the bone<br/>* Pad See You - delicious when you add pork belly<br/>* Hat Yai Fried Chicken: Big enough to share - I love that it includes naan and curry<br/>* Bone Broth: Portion size is small, but the flavors are delicious - some of the best broth I have ever had</p>',\n",

Farmhouse Kitchen is not your typical pad thai pad see ew thai joint in your local neighborhood. They have very good service and the interior is clean and nicely decorated. Their dishes here can also go up to $18 - $25 per person, but I have to say they have some of the best eye-catching beautiful plating of thai food I have ever seen. Also, BLUE RICE. They serve that here. Have you ever had blue rice before? I never had, until I came upon this place. <br/><br/>The dishes I have had here:<br/>Vegan Fresh Rolls ($9) - about 6 pieces of chopped up viet spring rolls with tofu inside. Definitely not worth the $9, but the taste is good. <br/>Hat Yai Fried Chicken ($16) - this is the dish with blue rice! The fried chicken is tasty and goes well with the vinegar sauce. The yellow curry also can act as a dipping sauce for the fried chicken! The portion size is big! <br/>Thai Street Green Curry Noodles ($16) - super good green curry! It can be spicier, but it was very creamy and fragrant. The curry had chicken or pork blood jelly which can be a new thing to try for some. The eggplants in this one were sooo sweet and creamy. <br/>Neua Yang Steak ($20) - wagyu beef steak can be served rare to well done. My coworker got the medium rare and it came nicely sliced. The waiter also lit it up using 151 rum on the table! It was literally ON FIRE. :) <br/><br/>If you are craving thai food in the mission district, I would recommend trying Farmhouse Thai out.

       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Farmhouse Kitchen Thai Cuisine is one of those fun places that is a bit different than your traditional Thai restaurant, which has deemed its Michelin Guide recommended status. I came here with a friend after running an errand in South San Francisco and thought if we had already crossed the Bay, we might as well go somewhere in the city for an early dinner at 5:30 on a Friday. <br/><br/>FOOD: Hat Yai Fried Chicken. The famous fried chicken of this place and it\\'s definitely worth ordering. The potato curry was very full body and the three pieces of potato were cooked to perfection. With the roti on the side, you can dip it in the shallow bowl of curry and enjoy the crunchiness of the roti with the saltiness and spices in the curry. Moving onto the chicken, this fried chicken ain\\'t a joke. It\\'s fried to perfection with a light batter that is fried at a very high temperature creating a nice thin, but very crisp texture on the outside. The chicken is very tender and not dried out and pairs well with the dipping sauce on the side. The blue rice, although does not taste very different from regular white rice, is visually appealing and adds a filling aspect to the dish. <br/><br/>SERVICE: Average, although I did find myself a little rushed towards the end of the meal service. Although I wasn\\'t done eating, my plate was almost taken away, but I got to enjoy my last few bites of the delicious fried chicken. <br/><br/>Although pricier than your typical Thai joint, this place has a twist on your standard Pad Thai plate. My only complaint with my dish that it was not as hot (temperature wise, not spiciness) when it came from the kitchen. I may have a temperature After we left at around 6:45, there was a line/wait, so I would highly recommend doing a reservation if you are looking at dining at a normal time on a weekend and want to get seated immediately.</p>',\n",

I managed to score a nice pilsner glass from throwing darts on the wall to blow up a balloon. <br/><br/>Overall, the food was excellent and the atmosphere was super lively and exciting!

They had these crunchy flakes in the bottom that were super good and topped with a spicy sauce.<br/>Hat Yat Fried Chicken: YUM! High recommend! The chicken was crispy and juicy, cooked very well. Comes with curry, blue rice and bread. <br/>Green Curry Noodles: OK, I would say pass. Too much coconut milk in the curry. It\\'s not bad but not authentic. <br/>House Soda: Interesting, made with lime, sugar and blue flower. It does go well with the spices but it\\'s not for everyone. It\\'s not sweet at all, kind of sour and bitter. <br/>Thai Ice Tea: Pretty good, had more ice than than tea though. <br/><br/>Overall, a very fun environment and great place for birthdays!

Our server was nice and always smiling but I think they only have one POS system terminal at the bar which was all the way across the other end if the restaurant. \\xa0Our server was constantly in front of that POS terminal and we waited to clear the used dishes to make room for all the food. Minus star for the service.<br/>Street parking only but not hard to find on a Sunday afternoon. \\xa0Note they only have one unisex restroom but it has to be the largest single restroom in the Bay Area.

Unless I drive over there, it\\'s a bit of a schlep especially if you\\'re counting on the 12 to pick you up sometime in your lifetime. However, my friend Maggie took the advice of a colleague of hers and invited Jamie W. and me to dinner at this spot of which I was completely unaware. Trick Dog and Central Kitchen are just around the corner, but I didn\\'t know this happening Thai eatery was attracting the young and hip all on its own.<br/><br/>It looked expansive when I first entered the empty restaurant, but it crowded quickly before we knew it. I got there first and ordered a $4.50 Classic Thai Tea just because I needed something refreshing (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2fBnKd3&amp;s=79f604beec5f6b1ca8f40ea4edc2aad44ffce8e0d0bea06876ce61db0717ea8a\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/2fBnKd3</a>). Once we sat at the table, I moved onto the even more refreshing $6.50 Whole Young Coconut, which is exactly what it was like I was on an episode of Gilligan\\'s Island with the Howells. It even had a pink straw and matching umbrella (photo: \\xa0<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2fP2jCW&amp;s=8aa152d3924757ca18b86709a9884cc9df178e623a80bc9659912de8144e5ddd\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/2fP2jCW</a>). Maggie decided to get something with more of a kick and landed on a $9.50 Thai Cooler which mixed a lager with fresh pineapple juice, lime, and cane sugar (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2gfssLK&amp;s=1df9c60aa080f20667ccc4fd17e6e0825819268e7cb1d92a7335a18a70afdb96\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/2gfssLK</a>).<br/><br/>We decided to share our plates and started with the $12 Ahi Scoops, a quartet of appetizer servings combining pan-seared Ahi tuna covered in black sesame seeds, cucumber, seaweed salad, crispy yam, dill, lemongrass, and chili lime (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2gwcZYe&amp;s=c7d1949c46466148d0b6c4deff1caad0e458dca0e04bf110c26a1a7ee69e5ad5\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/2gwcZYe</a>). Tasty bites with a nice contrast in textures, they were like maki rolls without the rice. We moved on to a $12 tureen of the popular Tom Kha, a luxuriant coconut soup with mushroom, tomato, galangal, kaffir lime, lemongrass, long coriander, and for $4 extra, fresh prawns (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2gJf06m&amp;s=0fc1addbb30779a96a3ee8b24a3cac0885305ef7427b484f086cbe2679ca0def\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/2gJf06m</a>). It was a lovely tropical broth that tasted creamy without having any cream in it.<br/><br/>Our entrees came next with the recommended $18 Hat Yai Fried Chicken arriving first. It\\'s a Southern Thai specialty that fries up a large chicken breast and adds fried shallots, turmeric, and other herbs in the coating. It came with a bowl of potato yellow curry, roti bread for dipping, and a scoop of intensely blue rice made from dok un sun (butterfly peas) (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2g2gAiz&amp;s=6fa28bf69ab8729df63b07a1786ea520e99e95eccebeaac38576b4f724ef5369\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/2g2gAiz</a>). The poultry was quite tender on its own, but the curry, rice and roti bread made it a more complete meal. The finale was the $22 Panang Neua, a large slow-braised, bone-in short rib with a Panang curry ladled over it.<br/><br/>It came with grilled broccolini, peppers, onion, fried basil, and more of that blue rice (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2gfzHmW&amp;s=1a3525dfef4c89c5bc8564a8228b2de685c1e15a009505f739c5f15c2f7a5be3\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/2gfzHmW</a>). That was definitely a high point with the meat falling off the bone with ease with the curry providing extra punch. For dessert, an indulgence I know after all that food, we decided to splurge and get the $26 Ruk Na Platter, a somewhat overpriced potpourri of most of their specialty desserts - taro sticky rice, coconut creme brulee, choco cake, a caramel macaron, and a wedge of fresh seedless watermelon (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2fP7F0L&amp;s=49270c6573d977907c17aaeec99df7dc3fe0126f2f01670ff4ac32ced5ead4db\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/2fP7F0L</a>).

I did however skim through the pricers and noted that this place is on the pricier side of thai food - but you\\'re paying for the great atmosphere and flavorful, adventurous thai foods. The 2 appetizers that I have tried were really good - it was the vegetarian spring rolls (which surprisingly tasted good but it\\'s because of the yummy peanut sauce it\\'s served with) and the thai sausages (which were super flavorful and sweet...). I also was able to try the Pad See Ew, the Red Chicken Curry, and the Yellow Tofu Curry. All of these were very very tasty and full of flavor. I thought the portion sizes were kinda small as I could finish it on my own (which i usually can\\'t). Overall, really reallly yummy tasting foods (but not sure if they are worth the price to you)!

For entree I got the crab fried rice which had sooo much fresh crab, it was a really great value for money. The portion was also huge and easily enough for two people. Finally a note on the bathroom, which is important and usually the mark of establishment. Cause let\\'s face it if even the bathroom is beautiful, trendy and smells good then the owners and staff are truly committed not just to great food but the company. The bathroom is beautiful and spacious and yup it has a guest list. \\xa0I highly recommend trying this place. The food is fantastic and it\\'s great for vegetarians and gluten free folks.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">The atmosphere was on and poppn on a Saturday night. Our hostess was rude though, glad she wasn\\'t handling our food. <br/>The wait was an hour, which apparently is normal for a weekend. Had the pad Thai, asked for it spicy and it was. Very small portioned but delicious. The Thai tea was good , taste like Thai tea anywhere else. <br/>I was pleased.</p>',\n",

I am sure there will be many more in the future.<br/><br/>Not only does this gem of a restaurant offer a casual and fun atmosphere, but the service is attentive and friendly, prices are moderate, and food is fabulous!<br/><br/>Farmhouse Kitchen is great for groups, and it\\'s super easy to make a reservation using Yelp Reservations. \\xa0On my recent visit earlier this week, the restaurant was decorated for Halloween and had candy bowls scattered throughout... \\xa0My party of 10 was seated promptly upon arrival. \\xa0We were offered water and drinks (we went with the Wonderwall Pinot Noir) within minutes, but given plenty of time to enjoy without feeling pressure to order food right away. \\xa0When we were ready to order, our server, Tonk, was super helpful... I was torn between several dishes and he helped me decide what to order (the green curry chicken). \\xa0This was in addition to some shared appetizers and sides (Vegan Fresh Rolls, Ahi Scoops, Spicy Eggplant and Asparagus). \\xa0<br/><br/>This place is known for their Hat Yai Fried Chicken, which I tried on my first visit, and it is delicious. \\xa0That being said, I don\\'t know that you can go wrong with your order here... everyone I dined with loved their meals. \\xa0If you go and you\\'re torn on what to order, go family style and share... or ask Tonk for a recommendation!<br/><br/>If you find yourself anywhere remotely close to Farmhouse with a craving for Thai food, this is your place!</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">SUMMARY: I would go back to try other dishes but not sure I would recommend to friends quite yet for the food or service - would recommend for cute and unique interior<br/>ORDERED: Tofu pad thai + spicy chai tea + steak roll appetizer + fried chicken plate<br/><br/>-----------------------<br/><br/>FOOD: Tofu pad thai was ok - lots of veggies which I typically love but the veggie to noodle ratio was a little too veggie heavy. Steak roll appetizer was DELICIOUS but too large to eat in one bite. The fried chicken plate I wouldn\\'t get again. It\\'s more of a fish and chips style fried chicken (not a big fan) with a delicious yellow curry but not much to dip in the curry.<br/><br/>DRINK: Spicy chai was not spicy nor chai-y. Wouldn\\'t get again. Other drinks may be good.<br/><br/>ATMOSPHERE: Beautiful - I walked by this place a while before I actually went to eat here and thought it was very cute. Interior is simple but romantic. Quiet enough to talk. <br/><br/>SERVICE: Slow and nothing to write home about, but not bad either.</p>',\n",

       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Farmhouse Kitchen Thai <br/><br/>I was expecting an awesome experience based on the hundreds of excellent reviews. However, I was a disappointed. I ordered based on the recommendations of the server. <br/><br/>RESTAURANT: <br/>Good vibe, open space and busy even for an early dinner. <br/><br/>You don\\'t have just one server when you order. There are multiple servers checking in on you so it\\'s hard to know who to flag when something is needed. Some were more friendly than others. <br/><br/>FOOD: <br/>Spring Rolls - 4 stars, fresh light clean taste. Definitely recommend if you want something light. The sesame seeds in the peanut sauce were really yum! <br/><br/>Crispy Prawns - 4 stars, the only thing missing was a sauce or diced mango for extra flavoring. <br/><br/>Papaya Salad - 2.5 stars, giving this a lower rating as the level spiciness cannot be chosen and is pre-made. It\\'s disappointing as most Thai restaurants, especially ones that charge $20 for most main dishes, should allow you to alter your spice preference on a papaya salad and prepared well in advance of service. <br/><br/>Pad Thai - 3 stars, greasy. The noodles were stuck together and very limited amount of vegetables for a veggie pad Thai. There were also 3 large inedible green vegetables almost as big as a finer in the plate.</p>',\n",

The decor is very cute (I\\'m very amused by their wall of faucets. <br/><br/>I highly recommend the 24 hour beef noodle soup, especially if it\\'s cold outside! <br/>I also tried the Hat Yai fried chicken and Panang Neus, both are also good options. <br/><br/>There may be a wait if you come during peak dining hours. Parking on the street. But staff is very friendly!</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Came here for my mom\\'s birthday after seeing photos of the place and loved how festive the place looked. First off, I have to say they provide you with the best customer service. It was pretty busy for a Monday night, but we still received great customer service. We were taken care of immediately (a reservation through Yelp definitely helped though). After ordering, I think our food came about 10 minutes later (maybe less?). However long it was, it\\'s the fastest I\\'ve ever gotten my food at a nicer, sit-down restaurant. And don\\'t think the speed compensated how good the food was because IT DID NOT.<br/><br/>Food: Besides the blue rice, which I thought was alright and tasted like regular jasmine rice, everything was pretty delicious. I got the Hat Yai Fried Chicken--chicken is fried and crispy, and it came with the blue rice, roti, and a sweet curry dipping sauce. I think this sauce also comes with the samosas, which I highly recommend as well. The exterior had a crust similar to an empanada which I\\'d never seen before in a samosa. My mom got the Mok Salmon, which came wrapped in banana leaves, leaving the entire thing super juicy. It comes with a spicy cilantro lime sauce that was a little too spicy for my mom and I, but I\\'m sure others would love. If you aren\\'t fond of spicy food, I wouldn\\'t recommend this though. Without the sauce, the salmon would be a bit boring. My dad and boyfriend got a Pad Thai with beef and Yum Moo Krob, a pork belly salad which were also pretty good.<br/><br/>Dessert: We got the croissant bread pudding which was perfectly baked and sweetened with caramel on top. If we weren\\'t so stuffed, we\\'d have finished the whole thing. Comes with vanilla ice cream, strawberries and whipped cream. My parents got the Yim-Yim with everything coconut. I don\\'t usually like coconut, but this was great. The server poured the cashews and coconut cream for us at our table with great enthusiasm--it was awesome.<br/><br/>Will definitely be coming back again!</p>',\n",

I am not saying it\\'s the best Thai food cause it might not be, but I loved everything we ordered.<br/>Surprisingly there wasn\\'t any waiting to get seated. Staff was dressed in some colourful shirts which looked more Hawaiian than Thai, but I\\'ve never been to either places so I\\'m probably wrong. Service is fast and friendly: they\\'re always there when you need something and don\\'t bug you every few minutes.<br/>I ordered the special which was some sort of curry noodles with chicken. There was A LOT of chicken in that dish. The meal wasn\\'t too spicy(I probably wish it was). We also got green curry with sticky rice. The rice came in a cute wicker sort of bowl. <br/>For appetizers we got some beef wraps. I can\\'t even express how soft and tasty the beef was! <br/>It probably shouldn\\'t matter much but the food was made to look appealing. Wasn\\'t just something done quickly to fill you up.<br/>With that being said this is one of the first places I\\'d visit once I go back to SF.</p>',\n",

I tried some of the chicken curry which was great as well. \\xa0The shrimp dish was also quite good. Everything was good. <br/><br/>I will definitely be back! \\xa0<br/><br/>P.S.

The restaurant is pretty cool that it re-purposed an old school and add some fun, modern decorations inside. Beware that the food is pricier than your average thai restaurant... I almost had a heart attack when I saw that one of their pad thai\\'s was $22.50. $22.50!! double the price of any ol pad thai...<br/><br/>Anywho, my number one tip is to MAKE RESERVATIONS! There\\'s a nonstop line of people waiting to get seated. And because of this, we felt like we were rushed to get through our dinner by our server. The menu is pretty extensive and it was a little annoying the server kept asking us if we\\'re ready to order. We wondered if there were choices of spiciness level, because the server for sure did not ask us... we joked she disliked us and just chose the spiciest setting for the mango salad (described below). <br/><br/>And onto the food... we ended up ordering the mango salad, fried chicken with yellow curry, extra roti, and pad thai. Yes, we are super whitewashed... the mango salad was spicy HOT! Just one bite and you can feel the burn. It was still good and flavorful though.<br/>Fried chicken was amazing, juicy and paired well w/ the curry. Roti was a little greasy, but also went well w/ the curry dip.<br/>pad thai was also solid. Pork was dry though.<br/><br/>We were full, but not bloated.. just ordered the right amount food. Amongst the 3 of us, it was only $20, which is amazing for SF. Woohoo!</p>',\n",

I don\\'t know how some reviewers spent $20 for a meal and a beer per person :( What did you order?! The table next to us spent $75 between two girls with no drinks and they were kind of surprised too. Overall, I felt underwhelmed especially because the boat noodle special wasn\\'t flavored boldly.

For my main meal, I grabbed my Thai go-tos: a huge papaya salad (medium spicy) and a Tom Kha with prawns. All I gotta say: SO GOOD! Both dishes were perfectly spiced and crazy delicious.

The fried chicken was juicy and the blue rice added a nice punch of color. Papaya salad was good, a bit spicy but tasty, and finally, the Tom yum noodle soup was HELLLLLA spicy. I have a pretty good spice tolerance, but this was kind of crazy. I tried to take a small sip of the soup just for the taste, and ended up choking because it was THAT spicy - BEWARE. <br/><br/>The kickboxing bowl was delicious!

From the creative plating to the intriguing food coloring (yes, I\\'m referring to the blue rice; yes, it tastes exactly the same as white rice), all their dishes come in beautiful presentations. There are also \"specialty dish\" carts that periodically swing by each table dim sum style.

Quite a filling meal, with all the roti bread and blue rice on the side.<br/><br/>// Thai Vacation ($9.50) - 4 stars<br/>Very cutely plated inside a fresh coconut, the Thai Vacation is a mixture of black sticky rice, vanilla ice cream, coconut cream, peanuts, and black sesame.</p>',\n",

       "  '<p lang=\"en\">I will probably, from hence forth, refer to this as one of the great Yelp-affirming experiences of my life. It\\'s no secret that I\\'m a fan of the site. I live it, I breathe it, I say the word every day, and I preach it from the tops of the mountains. But sometimes when you\\'re so far into the trees, you have a hard time seeing the forest. It\\'s experiences like this one that help me remember that big, beautiful forest that is Yelp, and how it\\'s completely changed my life for the better. <br/><br/>Enter Farmhouse Kitchen. It was a Wednesday night and I had some free time. I had a lot of work to do, and found myself taking too long at the hotel doing it, panicking, and abruptly grabbing my phone and wallet from the hotel to rush to the party supply store. I took a Lyft (thanks!), arrived in enough time to get what I needed, but by the time I could catch a breath I found myself back out on the curb, in a strange part of town, in the dark, hungry and ready for dinner.<br/><br/>Ten years ago, I wouldn\\'t have really known what to do. Go back to the hotel? Ask the guy at the party store? Sometimes I wonder what we did... did we just wander? There\\'s a certain adventure and sense of discovery that comes from that and I\\'ve found some gems that way, but instinctively I reached for the Yelp app and punched up nearby locations. With a few quick swipes and taps, I locked in Farmhouse. With another tap and rotate, I mapped the walk. And just like that, I was headed to a highly rated Thai spot. <br/><br/>This review isn\\'t all about Yelp, however, so let\\'s get down to the restaurant itself. When I was a block away I got that tingle. You know the one, don\\'t you, my fellow food lover? The one that starts with the faint scent of coconut milk, lemongrass, and fish sauce. Then it intensifies when stoked by the chatter and laughter that only a full restaurant house can produce. Then the tingling reaches maximum strength when windows reveal rows of happy diners, determined servers, lights reflecting off of clanking silverware and half-drunk wine glasses glistening under the warm yellow lights of a well-appointed interior.<br/><br/>Yes, the bar will be just fine. I passed the communal seating and plopped down. The tingling had become a warm, low burn when I checked the menu to find that sai ua (aka Chiang Mai sausage) was available, and they presented an adorable little card marking Khao Soi as the day\\'s special. These are my two favorite Thai dishes of all time, and I rarely find one of them, let alone both, in the same place. Again, I checked Yelp to see what people were ordering. Hat Yai was the clear consensus and when the server approached I closed my eyes and half-ordered, half-wished that they would all be as good as I hoped and as other Yelpers described them. Two entrees and an appetizer. I regret nothing.<br/><br/>By the time the sausage arrived I was drunk on the smells and kind service. The couple next to me was feeding each other, going on with each other and the staff in Thai. I tried the first piece of sai ua and the rest is a blur. I ate it. Fast. Then the khao soi. Perfectly pickles greens, crispy noodles (not everyone gives you this many to mix in, but the textural element it adds is invaluable) and thin noodles. I had the first piece of chicken and was almost disappointed it didn\\'t have bones. But sure enough, the second bite did--as did most bites--and that deep, rich flavor from bone-in chicken filled me up. Then the Hat Yai. The blue rice. The curry dipping sauce. Whatever magical vinegar honey sauce that was served with. I ate nearly everything and only stopped because I promised a friend a few tastes.<br/><br/>It was a Yelp-affirming night. In no other world would I have confidently walked right to an incredible Thai place like Farmhouse. I wouldn\\'t have found it otherwise. The personable servers made me feel at home as a solo diner. It felt like that restaurant, in this city, at that bar, eating those dishes was exactly the place I should be that night. No where else would have done.<br/><br/>These people understand flavors. Maybe you won\\'t have the same experience. That\\'s ok. It\\'s subjective, after all, and I don\\'t want to leave the hype that this is a magical place that transports you to an alternate food universe. It\\'s food, after all. But it was MY magical place. Go find yours. I know just the app.</p>',\n",

When we got here it was packed though! The place isn\\'t big so definitely make a reservation. Make sure your whole party is there though, we weren\\'t able to get seated until everyone arrived. Once you are seated service is fast and attentive. Our water was constantly refilled and food came fast as well!<br/><br/>The food here is some of the best in SF in my opinion. Prices are high, but they have specials that are a bit different from traditional thai dishes. Also, portion sizes are huge. Two girls can definitely share an entree and an appetizer. My friend ordered a thai-chelada which she really enjoined. For food, I ordered the Hat Yai Fried Chicken. If you like fried food you need to get this. The chicken is fried in a tempura-like way and super crispy and flavorful. The curry that comes with it is just as good. It\\'s not too sweet, but there is also a side of honey as a dipping sauce for the chicken. The flavors and textures paired together surprisingly well. The Thai Street Green Curry Noodles were also raved about and my friend loved it. <br/><br/>This place is cute too. Extra points for the little succulent that they put on our table.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Came here for a joint bday party. I was told that the owners of the restaurant also own Kitchen Story but Farmhouse Kitchen was more Thai VS Kitchen Story being more fusion.<br/><br/>The restaurant is located in a pretty secluded area in the mission. It was mostly warehouses when we drove by at night. It\\'s pretty easy to spot since majority of the area is pretty dead at night, we saw a bunch of people outside and figured that was the spot. Parking is pretty limited, but we managed to snag a spot across the street as someone was leaving.<br/><br/>The vibe is definitely more Asian than Kitchen Story and so was the menu. We ordered a bunch of appetizers, drinks, and everyone had an entre to themselves. For a party of 7 the bill came about to $450 after tip. They included a 20% gratuity for parties larger than 6. <br/><br/>The food wasn\\'t bad, but not the greatest Thai food I\\'ve ever had. For the price it\\'s a bit high for what I\\'m used to, but it\\'s SF and it is a popular spot so I get it. <br/><br/>Most likely won\\'t be back unless it\\'s with a group of friends... but all and all not a bad spot.</p>',\n",

       "  '<p lang=\"en\">I came to Farmhouse Kitchen with a colleague after work on weeknight. We wanted to go somewhere fun, but not too formal as we were on our way to a show. We did not make a reservation, but were still seated quickly and left within an hour. The service was extremely friendly, attentive, and fun. It would be the perfect place to \\xa0bring family or a group of friends for a special or celebratory dinner of some sort. <br/><br/>Too be honest, I didn\\'t get to explore the menu as much as I normally like to because my colleague was treating me (normally I will ball out and try everything if I\\'m paying). We both had the flower spritzer cocktail which was a nice way to start off the meal. It looks like it\\'ll be really sweet because of its bright pink color, but it\\'s actually really refreshing and balanced. We weren\\'t going to get any starters just for the sake of time, but while we were waiting for our food a server came around with street style food. He was carrying baskets of assorted fried vegetables and asked if we wanted some. I mean.... DUH! I\\'m not going to turn away a basketful of fried crunchy treats. I also got the green curry with beef and blue rice. It was so delicious. Green curry is already my favorite, but this was excellent. The vegetables were warm and tender, but still had a crispiness to them. The curry was thinner than I had normally had it, but not watery. I didn\\'t notice a huge difference in flavor, but the blue rice was really gorgeous. <br/><br/>The atmosphere as a whole was so fun. It was trendy and modern, but had authentic and traditional decor as well. The bathroom was large and very clean. I am looking forward to my next meal here!</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">First time here and I am so amazed by the creative and delicious entrees! \\xa0I have to commend them as the presentation is on point. \\xa0I usually like to fall in love with my food before I devour it. <br/><br/>Started off with the Wagyu Flank Steak appetizer rolls and every bite was amazing! \\xa0The steak was juicy, tender &amp; paired well with the mint, cilantro, cucumber &amp; dressing. \\xa0Everyone on Yelp raved about the Hat Yai Fried Chicken- Mary\\'s Organic Chicken Breast with roti bread, yellow curry &amp; rice. \\xa0 They were not wrong. \\xa0It was an incredible fusion of flavor to dip the chicken in the curry. \\xa0That curry...YUMM! \\xa0However, the Panang Neua- slow braised bone in Short Rib in a Panang Curry stole the show for me... \\xa0*Sigh* \\xa0I\\'m still dreaming about how that tasty succulent meat falls off the bone and into my mouth. \\xa0<br/><br/>The service was great and the atmosphere was very lively and festive. \\xa0Will I be back? \\xa0It\\'s not a matter of \"If\" but \"When...\" =)</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Cool place! I get Thai food fairly often, and this is SOME of the best I\\'ve had. The place was absolutely slammed, so reservations were clutch. Service was pretty quick, it has to be do they can free up tables. Compared to my usual places, the prices were a few bucks over the norm. Good, but not great, but I guess the buzz justifies the cost. Hip place to check out once or twice, but couldn\\'t see myself becoming a regular.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Mixed. The menu and ambiance were exciting, and the tom kha ga soup was AWESOME. Red curry was so-so and the service was RUSHY RUSHY - like over the top - we got PUSHED OUT. Uncool.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">This place is amazing! As of today, it has been open for over a year and a half ...and i am sure it\\'s not going anywhere!! <br/><br/>This is a northern style restaurant and it is reminiscent of Andy Ricker\\'s Pok Pok, but maybe even more enjoyable! It is currently Michelin recommended! <br/><br/>The appetizer line up has flavors that are bright, balanced and have sweet and sour notes, in a majorly good way. My absolute favorite appetizer was the Mien Kum Kung which are crispy crusted tiger prawns, served with \\xa0leafy green veggie (not sure what the leaf was, raw collard greens, perhaps) with a zesty mixture of lime, ginger, onion, roasted coconut and peanuts with tamarind sauce. This effin appetizer is so effin good, i would not be mad if that was one of my last bites i ever ate! That little mixture under the prawn is surely to contain particles of crack, cuz it is addictive! \\xa0You must get this remarkable dish folks!<br/><br/>We also tried the Neua Num Tok Rolls which are snake river farm wagyu flank steak wrapped with mint, cilantro, cucumber served with cilantro lime vinaigrette. The steak was very tender and the combination of the other ingredients make it a well balanced bite, it is served four \\xa0per order.<br/><br/>The Crispy Calamari are curry battered monterey squid in spicy pepper served with a cilantro lime sauce. This is very good especially if you are one of those people like me that if calamari is on the menu, u will get it....so get it. The only thing thats it\\'s missing is tentacles, no tentacles! All calamari lovers love tentacles! <br/><br/>Now to the main dishes...<br/><br/>This is the house that Hat Yai Fried Chicken Dinner built!! This dish keeps coming out that kitchen all day long yo...and for a reason, it is fire!!! This is a Southern style dish with Mary \\'s chicken breast, turmeric and herbs, fried shallots, roti bread, potato yellow curry for dipping and purpleish rice....the big colorful plate has all these tiny bits too, well the fried shallots...and cucumber and a little dish of sweet and sour sauce. My party all agreed that this was the best dish. The chicken is outstandingly tender and fresh and the batter is so crispy and puffy. The roti and the curry are super good together. The curry sauce is very sweet and light. <br/><br/>The other dish we had was the Kai Yang Som Tum Dinner which consists of half a Mary\\'s organic BBQ chicken marinated in turmeric and coconut milk, papaya salad, sticky rice (the menu says you get black sticky rice but we got white) and roasted rice sauce. The chicken was very tender, but it could\\'ve used some grill marks or char points, in my op. The papaya salad us easily the best i\\'ve ever had because of the shocking balance of flavors! The rice was HELLA sticky, like so sticky, the rice particles did not want to part ways with each other...that was the only sucky part if the entire meal. The chicken too, I mean it takes effort to eat chicken on bone especially if you share, so i may skip this another time, due to laziness...<br/><br/>I\\'m ghetto, so i brought my own coke zero, cuz no places have coke zero (well some) but the waitress said she would get in trouble if she brought me a glass full if ice... So...I put my zero away...my mom insisted that I should get a Thai Iced Tea, but i didnt want to, because i didnt need more calories. She said it was the best one shes ever had and she orders it at every thai place in SF...she said something about the texture of the ice (looked like cruahed ice) makes it extra special...<br/><br/>The decor is super cute and the music is groovy, like not sure if it was English or Thai...or maybe i cant remember...parking can be difficult! <br/><br/>One more thing that was dope about this establishment is that in SF terms, it is huge! Lots of tables and space....it kinda says \"we knew we were gonna be successful and need a big ass place in SF standards\" It looks like they have performances of Thai dancing at times, maybe just not during lunch. Another cool point is that they seem to value diversity and hire a diverse staff!! <br/><br/>All in all, great place that pays attention to tiny details in all aspects! Service was attentive and friendly as well. Come early, it gets crackin\\'</p>',\n",

I asked the waiter if they could change it, but they said that I could have asked for the sauce on the side, wait what? on the side? A papaya salad COME WITH the dressing, never on the side. \\xa0They should clearly indicate the level of spice.<br/><br/>Other than that, every dish is very flavorful and we were all happy :)</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">MMMMMMMMMMMMMM. Delicious and affordable Thai food, presented bountifully and beautifully in a spacious, modern, industrial space in the Mission area. RESERVATIONS RECOMMENDED.<br/>Think it came out to $45 per person for 2 of us after tax and tip with a beer each and we were STUUFFFFFFFED.<br/>The service is extremely active, fast, and friendly. You can tell they definitely work as a well-oiled machine.<br/>This area is still up and coming.. there are some nice restaurants scattered here, but you\\'ll likely pass by some homeless encampments as well. Oh, SF.<br/><br/>I walked in on a Friday evening at 5:30 and one of the hostesses told the lady in front of me (that was trying to get a walk-in) that they were already pretty booked for the night and couldn\\'t seat her early until her whole party was there. ZANG YO. I didn\\'t expect a wait at this place, so early in the night, away form the hustle and bustle of the main strip of Mission... so I already knew I was in for some good food.<br/><br/>Based on the Yelp reviews, we opted for:<br/><br/>NEUA NUM TOK ROLLS - 5 STARS. The only thing that could make this better is if they portioned it out smalller. The piece of meat was a bit too big and I would have savored it more if it came in a smaller bite, maybe halved. But it was SO TENDER AND DELICIOUS and went perfectly went the fresh cucumber and mint. Comes with 4 \\'rolls\\' and is a pretty big appetizer for 2 people. Perfect for 4 though.<br/><br/>HERBAL RICE SALAD - 4 STARS. People said that if you like the tea leaf salad, you\\'d probably like this.. well, the flavor isn\\'t really the same but you\\'d probably like this if you like coconut and peanuts! I like coconut and peanuts, soo.. yeah. <br/><br/>HAI YAT CHICKEN - 4.5 STARS. YUMM. Two thin pieces of juicy fried chicken served with roti, rice and curry. The only thing that would make this better is MORE POTATOES IN THE CURRY (but I\\'m a potato fiend and I\\'m really asking for too much - haha). The presentation is awesome with the knife thru the roti and the chicken, along with the blue rice. I think they just dye the rice blue as it doesn\\'t taste any different.<br/><br/>Would love to return as a group to try more things as well as the big alcoholic drink in a bowl!! AGAIN - make reservations, definitely come and try this place!</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Great food here! Nice, fun, young crowd. It\\'s a lively place with a lot of color and laughter!<br/><br/>For apps we had the samosas and the flank steak rolls. Both were great. \\xa0<br/><br/>I had the pad kee mow as my main and my bf had the hat yai fried chicken. I got mine medium spicy and was very happy with the spice and flavor. Yum!His dish was good too, but here\\'s the thing to know when you go. When you order the samosas, they come with a delicious curry sauce to dunk them in. The curry sauce that is served with the Hat Yai fried chicken is either the same or very similar to what is served with the samosas. I could have eaten my bf\\'s dish in a heartbeat, but he was expecting a different flavor in the dish.<br/><br/>That doesn\\'t take away from how great the food is or the dish- its just good to know before you order.<br/><br/>Will be back- and oh! Drinks are awesome!!</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Farmhouse definitely has ambiance, but not the type of ambiance that\\'s for everyone. My family and I came here after a long day of hiking since my brother was in the mood for Thai. I checked online for open reservations around 6:15p, and seeing none until 8p, I didn\\'t see the point when we were going to get there around 6:30p anyways. No way a party of 4 would have to wait for 1.5 hours, right? <br/><br/>Walking off the quiet streets of this part of the Mission into Farmhouse was something like stepping out of a chimney after using Floo Powder. It\\'s dimly light, colorful, and festive inside - an assault on pretty much all your senses. We put our name down, were told about a 40 minute wait, and settled on some of the colorful plastic stools in front of the reception desk. A cheesy parody music video was being projected on the screen facing us, and loud Thai music made it difficult to converse so we tried looking at the menu instead. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, it was holiday season and my presumption that Farmhouse managed their floor service like most other restaurants and held at least 1/3 of the seating for walk-ins did not hold. Ordering takeout would have been more efficient. This would not have been too much of a problem had the front house staff been more upfront about their seating system and wait time (every \"10 more minutes\" turned into 30), and had a brush-up on PR skills. The bathrooms were at least a nice refuge, the far back one being a spacious vault with one toilet and two sinks. And a sign-up list for their top secret club. <br/><br/>As we were superseded by group after group of people, each seemingly larger than the last, I had the fleeting thought that maybe reservations superseded any semblance of a waitlist for walk-ins. The only entertaining moment during the waiting game was when a server went around with fried crickets to the diners (not us, part of the Crowd Behind the Desk) to offer his wares. Over an hour later, I was regretting not just making an Open Table reservation for 8p because I wasn\\'t even sure we would get in at that time. Several other groups around us, even with reservations, were getting antsy and two groups decided to leave. <br/><br/>Just before 8p we were seated at the draftiest table, being closest to the door. A vegetable salad was dropped on the table before us, and my sulking mother was determined to find everything else wrong with the restaurant. Unfortunately, they got her order wrong (she ordered the Chicken Noodle Soup and was given the Vegetable version) and I ended up switching my Tom Kha Soup w/ Chicken with her as mollification. These items were just average, but my brother was quite happy with his super-tender Panang Neua (short rib) and ended up eating half of my dad\\'s Hat Yai Fried Chicken, so at least there was one happy stomach at the end of the meal. The portion sizes seemed about right for dinner pricing - the noodle soups particularly so. The dishes were unlike other Thai places I\\'ve been to - and I\\'ve never been to Thailand - so I can\\'t speak to how authentic they actually were, but it definitely appeals to the SF crowd. <br/><br/>During the meal, the waitstaff was pretty attentive and kept the water glasses full. But about halfway through the meal, it became obvious they were rushing to turn over tables and nearly took away my brother and my dad\\'s plate three times. Calm. Down. What irritation had dulled now rose again to the surface, and I\\'m sorry to say that we all left with a sour aftertaste. I recognize that my experience was affected by the timing of the visit, but I don\\'t think I\\'ll be coming back to re-experience the poor service and average food.</p>',\n",

Everything from the roti bread to the chicken and curry were good. The fried chicken was super crispy and juicy. The green curry was also fantastic. It came with some garnishes and noodles on the side. Also loved the little kick of spiciness in the curry. All around great meal.</p>',\n",

Surprisingly our wait was only 30 minutes on a Friday night. Not what I was expecting at all but it was so really cool. Service was great - prompt and very friendly.<br/>Food - <br/>24 hr beef noodle soup - Full of flavor, the short rib was sooo tender and fell right off the bone. I did ask for medium spicy and it felt a little mild to me. Maybe it\\'s just my taste buds but I could\\'ve had a little more heat. <br/>Thai Iced Tea - Presentation was beautiful and unique with a ball of crushed ice on top. It\\'s hard to find an authentic thai iced tea in the US but this one was really really close. <br/>Hubby had a steak entree that was lit on fire.

Great flavors, strong spices, but nothing too overpowering. Everything comes in generous serving portions, and the coconut rice and blue rice are an especially nice touch. They\\'ve also got a great dessert menu. I\\'ve only tried the Yim-Yim, a dish of coconut ice cream, shaved almonds, coconut meat.

       "  '<p lang=\"en\">This is my favorite thai spot in SF. First I thought the dishes were pretty over-priced, but the food is amazing (you also have to get the right dishes). I came here several times with large groups because there\\'s lots of tables and waiting is max 15-20 min (hard to find such places in SF). The restaurant has a fun, clean vibe. <br/><br/>Here are my reviews in order of my favorite dishes.<br/>1. Hat Yai Fried Chicken - 100% will not regret ordering this. The serving can feed almost 2 people. The chicken is so juicy and crispy. So perfect with the sweet and sour sauce. The curry dip comes with yuka (first I thought they were potatoes) and slices of naan? platha? This part of the dish tastes very similar to Burma Love\\'s platha dip which is my go-to appetizer. <br/><br/>2. Grilled River Prawns Pad Thai - Is $20 pad thai really worth it? yes. The prawns are HUGE and so fresh. I love their pad thai although it can be a bit sweet for some people. Treat yoself to some expensive and darn good pad thai. <br/><br/>3. Green curry with crispy pork belly - At first I totally judged this combination, but you need to try their crispy pork belly. I couldn\\'t stop eating them. I like how their curry has a lot of vegetables. <br/><br/>Dishes I didn\\'t like:<br/>- Papaya salad was way too spicy and too saucy <br/>- Tom Yum was also super spicy<br/>- Pad Kee Mao\\'s noodles were too overdone<br/><br/>I like their thai iced tea and honey milk lavender!</p>',\n",

Somewhat cool is that they periodically come around with traditional carts with \"specialties\" almost dim sum style. \\xa0Total throw back to being in Thailand and an extremely smart marketing ploy. \\xa0Who could say no to $3 fried grasshoppers that you know someone at your table will just HAVE to try?<br/><br/>Service, once seated, was excellent. \\xa0However, they were super behind on seating reservations. \\xa0We made a reservation for 7 PM and we weren\\'t seated until 7:30 PM. \\xa0We saw other tables being seated before us and asked why and they said it was because they had a 6:45 PM reservation. \\xa0However, to apologize for making us wait, they did comp us an appetizer of delicious spring rolls.<br/><br/>FOOD<br/>We ordered the Hai Yat Fried Chicken (duh!), Green Curry Noodles, Crab Fried Rice, and Drunken Noodles with Crispy Pork Belly. \\xa0Each dish was exquisitely presented, colorful, well-balanced, and generously portioned. The rice is even blue! \\xa0I thought this was a gimmick...but apparently it\\'s a real thing! \\xa0It\\'s dyed with a special blue flower. \\xa0<br/><br/>The standout, not surprisingly, was the Hai Yat Fried Chicken. \\xa0Love the roti and the curry that the chicken is served with. \\xa0In fact, we ordered an extra bowl of rice and kept refusing them to take the dish away because we wanted to slurp up and sop up every last bit of the yellow curry it is served with. \\xa0Definitely a must-order! <br/><br/>The green curry noodles were also really flavorful, but definitely much more on the spicier end. \\xa0Plentiful with curry and lots of garnishes (bean sprouts, cucumbers, basil leaves, pickled vegetables, other unnameable herbs, etc.) but a little light on the amount of noodles given. \\xa0The crispy pork belly in the drunken noodles was also great! \\xa0But, what\\'s not to love about drunken noodles?<br/><br/>Each dish is around $20 so this is definitely not somewhere I could eat on the regular but it\\'s a nice treat! \\xa0And, I will definitely be back!</p>',\n",

I get it, everyone is impressed by the fried chicken dish, but come on folks let\\'s try to move beyond that novelty and look at the entirety of the menu . Would not eat here again. Here\\'s a breakdown of the pros and cons:<br/><br/>Pros: <br/>-Fresh herbs, traditional pungent flavors<br/>-Flavor profile of most dishes close to what you would get in Thailand versus Americanized Thai Cuisine (sweet and not herbal or complex)<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- pricing is ridiculously high for small portions. Many dishes run between $20- $28 for factory farm beef/pork.<br/>- some dishes such as the rice salad ($14) are syrupy-sweet.<br/>- green curry noodles ($20) are very disappointing. Simply a bowl of green curry with a small side of mushy overcooked vermicelli rice noodles. Again, not sure what justifies the price. Chicken was full of tiny very sharp bones. <br/>- dishes are small and not meant for Asian style sharing. When I asked for more rice noodles because there wasn\\'t enough to share among the four of us, our waiter told us portions are meant to be for \"one person only\" we were then charged $5 for an additional tiny side of mushy vermicelli \\xa0noodles. Would one person really want to eat an entire bowl of green curry and nothing else? <br/>- fish cake was rubbery with no detectable kaffir lime. <br/>- despite use fresh herbs many of the dishes were not layered or complex. I love spicey but \\xa0every dish was overwhelming even thoughwe ordered medium. This place was so one-dimensional couldn\\'t taste any of the other flavors. This is a typical trick of some new Thai places to make people believe they\\'re eating authentic Thai food by simply cranking up the heat.<br/>- the tarot and rice dessert is unimaginative--simply mashed Taro on top of a bed of rice with sugar and some coconut milk.<br/>- at least four or five times the waiter tried to take away dishes that still had plenty of food on them. We found ourselves fighting him off for the majority of the meal. It eventually became so comical that at least it brought some good laughs.<br/><br/>The people running this restaurant are very smart and savvy, they\\'ve tapped into a very young \"hip\" consumer base in San Francisco that doesn\\'t care about paying twice the price for something with no justification.<br/><br/>For those Thai food aficionados interested in an \\xa0authentic experience checkout the plethora of Thai restaurants on San Pablo Avenue in Albany which are less than half the price of Farmhouse.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">I ordered the pumpkin curry, green curry, and pad see ew. I asked for the pumpkin curry to be Thai spicy, and the others to be medium spicy. <br/>Al 3 dishes were made Thai spicy. When I called to get the 2 dishes replaced, the guy on the phone argued with me, and told me that I must not be used to spice, and that I probably ate the spicy dish first, and that\\'s why the other dishes were too spicy. <br/>After I told him that I tried the Pad see ew first, then the green curry, and those were crazy spicy, he told me I was wrong. <br/>He wouldn\\'t admit that they made the dishes wrong, and was a complete jerk over the phone. <br/>I love spicy food. I use tons of siracha on my meals. This was the spiciest food I\\'ve ever tasted. <br/>Forget these guys. They are assholes. Next time<br/>I\\'ll order from Kitchen Story -- they always get the spicy levels right. Medium is medium -- not Thai spicy.</p>',\n",

       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Found my new favorite thai place! Farmhouse offers delicious food that I find quite unique from other Thai restaurants that I\\'ve tried. <br/><br/>I ordered the Hat Yai ($16) fried chicken breast with blue rice, roti, curry dip, and some pickled cucumbers/veggies on the side. I was worried the chicken breast would taste dry but boy was I wrong. It was juicy, perfectly fried, and flavorful. You could dip it in the curry or the sweet and sour sauce. I liked how there was so much going on with this dish, as I could dip my roti with the curry or out the curry on the rice, etc- it was an experience. Would definitely recommend this dish. I ordered it because it was so popular on yelp and I could see why. The bf was definitely having entree envy. <br/><br/>The bf ordered Panang Neua ($20) braised short rib with blue rice. Flavorful and tender but we both enjoyed the fried chicken above more.<br/><br/>Overall, we think we\\'ve found our favorite Thai restaurant in the city! The prices are a bit pricy but typical for SF and the portions are big at least. Delicious food, large portions, and friendly service. We came on a rainy day so there was not that much people, but I can imagine it getting crowded during peak hours.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">I love this place. I am recently gluten free and this place is perfect for the gf peeps who crave Thai food. Before my gluten sensitivity, I would get the chicken and blue rice. The chicken is cooked perfectly where the outside is crispy and the inside is juicy. It also comes with a side of roti and curry dipping sauce which is tasty as well. The consistency of the sauce is a bit watery but I didn\\'t mind. The last 2 times I\\'ve been there, I ordered from the gluten free menu and got the crispy pork belly fried rice. Yes, both times (within a week) because it is that good! The fried rice was flavored nicely and more importantly NOT oily. The crispy pork belly has a lot of fat but I thought it paired nicely with the rest of the dish. The servers are friendly, attentive, and great with making suggestions. For dessert, I tried a bite of the bread pudding and it was okay..nothing special about it. I wasn\\'t fond of the texture but mixed with the ice cream it wasn\\'t bad! <br/><br/>The only thing about eating here is that it\\'s gets super loud so if you\\'re trying to engage in a deep conversation, you may want to sit super close or save it for after dinner. <br/><br/>I am coming back for you crispy pork belly fried rice !! Get in ma bellay!</p>',\n",

From the greeting to receiving the check, the entire experience had been wonderful. Definitely the most authentic Thai restaurant I\\'ve ever been to. <br/><br/>For appetizers, we ordered the Ahi Scoops and Neua Num Tok rolls. The Ahi Scoops have sriacha on top so it has a spicy kick to it. My favorite part (outer layer) of the Neau Num Tok rolls is the meat. It\\'s very tender, so it made it easy to eat. The rolls are pretty big! For entrees, we ordered the Hat Yao Fried Chicken and Mom Salmon. The salmon and chicken were delish and not dry. The curry in the Hat Yao dish was . The fact I have to use emojis to describe how I feel says something lol. Sorry there are no photos.

       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Cute exterior, interior, and servers ;) <br/><br/>This place seemed a mix of hipster, artsy, and formal all at the same time. My sister and I went on a random Wednesday evening and there was parking right outside. We didn\\'t have a reservation so they were going to place us in the middle of the room, but we said we preferred to be against a wall. Although we pointed at the booths, she took us to an awkwardly small table that was right next to the bathroom. Um.<br/><br/>But let me get to the important part - FOOD:<br/>- complimentary salad (watch out, it has a kick!)<br/>- hat yai - chicken was crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. roti nicely chewy. curry consistency very watery; would be better to be less sweet to offset all the oil/fried stuff on the plate<br/>- panang neau - blue rice was cool. just rice though? no special flavoring along with it. short rib was fall off the bone mmmm<br/>- drinks: sparking peach jelly, coco lada - sister had both of these drinks lol. She was surprised at the jelly bits inside the 1st cuz you can\\'t see it. Said she couldn\\'t taste the alcohol. 2nd one, she liked better cuz it was lighter. This one seemed bottomless! She kept drinking but the level would barely go down lol <br/>- fried crickets - didn\\'t try, but it was cool how there was a server going around asking if people wanted to purchase some to try it!<br/><br/>All of these had AMAZING visuals - large portions, great color themes on the plates. I honestly want to say that the taste of all of these didn\\'t blow me away, but they were very filling and we loved the different textures and flavors that they included. Service was great in the beginning, but as it got busier into the night (nice diverse crowd, btw), they got slightly negligent. About $85 with tip for all this. So yes, on the pricey side, but considering SF and everything, very worth it. Happy bellies = happy experiences. <br/><br/>*** TL:DR - Cute and instagram-worthy + good food experience. I would come here again (b).</p>',\n",

In the meantime, one of the servers snaked through the restaurant while balancing baskets of snacks on his shoulders. I was delighted and stimulated by these funny gimmicks. Kin Khao may be one of the most renowned Thai joint in town, but Farmhouse is by far the wildest!</p>',\n",

We had no reservations, so it was understandable. To our surprise, we were seated a lot sooner than expected. <br/><br/>Our waitress was super polite and answered our questions without any hesitation. I ordered the Hat Yai Fried Chicken and it was perfection! I highly recommend ordering it! I vacationed in Thailand last year and I still think the curry that the Hat Yai Chicken comes with is one of the best I have tasted! It come with roti for dipping in the curry but I ended up dipping the chicken in the curry as well. One thing I noticed is that they pay a lot of attention to their guests and throughout our whole dinner, our water glasses were constantly filled every minute. No water glass reminded half empty. <br/><br/>Overall, I would definitely come back for more. The ambience was perfect. Slightly intimate but not overly loud/hectic. Farmhouse has definitely become one of my favorite restaurants.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">I have always had this place bookmarked for the longest time and I am so happy I finally tried it! Hidden in a less busy part of the mission, Farmhouse Thai Kitchen might be hard to find, but I promise they offer a memorable experience. For starters, Farmhouse Thai Kitchen has a nice interior and set up. And they also take reservations in advance. <br/><br/>Favorite Dishes (If you are going to get something, I highly suggest getting these two) : <br/>-24 hour beef noodle soup - so flavorful and good enough for 3-4 people! The beef is so succulent and the noodles aren\\'t too overcooked. Might be a little on the salty side for some people, but it was my favorite dish hands down. <br/>-Hat Yai Fried Chicken: Blue rice. Thai spiced Fried chicken. And a flavorful curry. Hell yea!!! <br/><br/>The pad thai and fish cakes taste like your regular Thai dishes, but they are very flavorful and are great for starters. Also, the fish cakes portion is small, but it is darn beautiful. I had a great experience, despite the waiter commenting on my parents and I only ordering a couple dishes. We even had leftovers and the waiter seemed annoyed at us. Other than this, I would definitely venture out to Farmhouse Thai if I am in the area again!</p>',\n",

       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Definitely a fun place to check out while in the Bay area. Our group was on a trip there and we had a birthday girl so despite of the location (quite far from downtown), we came here for a birthday dinner. I would suggest making a reservation if you have a large group cause it gets pretty crowded. <br/><br/>Okay first impression, the vibe of this place screams \"overpriced hippie joint\" (plot twist: it\\'s not). The staff dressed in tropical clothing with flower necklace and crown(?). Around the tables were vintage decoration such as old fashioned sewing machine, old food cans, and old toys. As we were navigating through the big as* menu with Thai titles and English description, a waitress kept coming back and forth every 20 seconds to ask if we\\'re ready to order, which was kinda annoying. She also seemed uninterested and impatient when my friends had some questions about the menu. <br/><br/>Anyway, setting that aside, we ordered some appetizers, Neua Num Tok (steak roll with cucumber), Yum Moo Krob (house grilled pork belly salad) and a Tom Yum pot for sharing. The steak roll was high quality and the pork belly salad was really well seasoned. Tom Yum was just okay, not the best I\\'ve tried. We each ordered a special set ourselves so we got to try as many dishes as possible lol. I had the Crab Fried Rice my self and it was perfect. The fried rice smelled really good and there was a lot of crabmeat as well. It also came with a bowl of light and hearty veggie soup and some dipping sauce. A lot of people came here for the Hat Yai Chicken so we tried it as well. I wasn\\'t impressed with the fried chicken itself (c\\'mon, it was chicken breast) but the yellow potato curry including in the set was on fire! I\\'m normally not a fan of curry at all but it was so good you feel like there\\'s an explosion of flavors in your mouth. I would also recommend the Panang Neua, which is braised short rib and veggies in panang curry (but more like panang flavored soup). It\\'s definitely not a typical Thai dish you can get anywhere. I would not recommend the Mok Salmon (too dry) and Kai Yang, Som Tum (nothing special) tho. <br/><br/>If you have a birthday person in your group, you can order the Dessert Platter and when they bring it out for you the whole staff will play gong (yes, the metal round thingy) and sing for him/her. I think it\\'s a nice service of them. But if it\\'s not the celebration then never mind cause it was basically some scoops of ice cream, watermelon and some irrelevant sweets. <br/><br/>Overall, the price is more pricey than an average Thai place but you totally get what you paid for. The food is unique and delicious and you will have a fun time as well.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">We had reservations for brunch so we were seated relatively quickly but the restaurant wasn\\'t too busy. I ordered the Mok Salmon and that came out relatively quickly. The salmon was good and was filling enough but it started out a little dry and was juicy as I got towards the middle and end of it. The asparagus was cooked just right, not too soggy. The ambiance is nice and bright. They were playing traditional music mixed in with more modern tracks which added to the dining experience.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">3.5 STARS<br/><br/>Remember that nightclub, Whisper? Yah, those were THE days...you can hear the ratchetness and smell the camel toes from a mile away.<br/><br/>Enter the hipsters and tech bros: Whisper is gone and the just as pseudo fancy Circolo (just as ghetto as Whisper when it was a club) across the street is gone.<br/><br/>Although this part of the Mission is still gentrifying, it\\'s come a long way from what it was 6-7 years ago. Super cute restaurants like Farmhouse Kitchen Thai Kitchen have taken residence along with multi-million dollar lofts that I will never be able to afford. But, that\\'s gentrification for ya right?<br/><br/>At first glance, the prices at Farmhouse Kitchen may seem high for Thai food but they\\'re justifiable. They use local and organic ingredients, and the portions are generous (enough for another meal). Plus, the presentation of every dish is instagrammable worthy - beautifully plated with vibrant colors that pop. <br/><br/>After an offsite work meeting, I stopped by Farmhouse Kitchen for lunch. No need to peruse the menu as I knew what I wanted to order, the much raved about Hat Yai Chicken: Southern style fried chicken, yellow potato curry, roti, blue jasmine rice ($16): <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1VCfJUJ&amp;s=e91d70780ff7d9a9697d942219af0cd701d60a49e68b0858e558fafee7650f1f\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/1VCfJUJ</a>. The fried chicken breast had a satisfying crunch and was nicely tender. I immersed each piece into the curry sauce and wrapped the flaky roti around it to make a mini kati roll. The blue rice was just dyed rice. I had plenty of leftovers for dinner. When I ate the different components separately at dinner, I noticed that the chicken was sour (too much citrus in marinade?) and the curry dipping sauce was too sweet. This went unnoticed at the restaurant as curry sauce balanced out the sourness of the chicken. <br/><br/>Also, ordered their House Soda ($3.50) which was refreshing but a little too concentrated for my liking. Needed to be diluted a bit more. <br/><br/>Props for the lightning fast service (received my order in 5 minutes) since I had to go back to the office but one of the servers had a bit of a diva attitude - an unspoken sass with his body language. <br/><br/>Me: \"Hi!\"<br/>Him: \"Ready to order?\"<br/><br/>Me: \"Yes, I like to order the...thank you!\"<br/>Him: *flips hair*<br/><br/>*Server places check on the table*<br/><br/>Me: \"Thank you!\"<br/>Him: *flips hair and quickly turns away*<br/><br/>He didn\\'t actually *flip his hair* (it\\'s an idiom) but he gave off the \"whatever, girlfriend\" vibe. Not a deal breaker but the lack of mannerisms and response was off-putting. The other taller male server with the side swept bangs was really nice though. He read my mind when I wanted a glass of water and nicely packed my leftovers into different compartments. <br/><br/>Usually the ambiance and décor at Asian restaurants are an afterthought. This is definitely a restaurant for the millennials, it\\'s hip, trendy, and great for groups. Too bad, there\\'s no full bar.<br/><br/>Parking is VERY difficult during the weekdays. Since there\\'s no meters or time limitations on parking (other than street cleaning), people that work and live in the area park all day in the area. I got lucky. As I was driving down the street, someone pulled out of their space. Parking on the weekend should be much easier. <br/><br/>Kin Khao and Lers Ros (original TL location) are still my top picks for Thai food but Farmhouse Kitchen is great for a hot date and chic group together. Please work on that *hair flip* though!</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Different than any other Thai restaurant I\\'ve ever eaten at! A couple of my friends and I had the Ahi tuna scoops and lemongrass flavored soup for appetizers and they were good. The tuna was a little fishy but overall good. For our entrees we had the fried chicken with yellow curry, pappaya salad (way tooo spicy) and BBQ chicken. Thai ice tea was great! Overall good, cool Thai comfort food and trendy joint to go with friends.<br/><br/>Went for a second time, had the beef ribs, chicken wings and Thai vacation dessert! All three were a hit!!</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Farmhouse has quickly become a staple for my boyfriend and I, and therefore, it is hands down my favorite Thai spot in SF. Go if you like flavorful, TASTY, delicious Thai food with a bit of spice. <br/><br/>The hefty portions are affordable in comparison to other \"hip\" Thai/Asian Fusion restaurants in SF), and the best part is that the food is TASTY (did I already say that?). If I could dream of what authentic Thai food tastes like, Farmhouse is pretty much close to what I would expect the real deal to be. As someone who personally loves salty, flavorful foods, Farmhouse nails the Hat Yai Fried chicken with curry, naan, and blue rice. The batter on the chicken has the perfect crunch and isn\\'t dried like many other Thai fried chicken dishes that I\\'ve tried. My favorite part about this dish is the curry that\\'s included - it simply makes everything all the more creamier and tastier! My boyfriend typically orders the Panang Neua, which is a slow braised bone in short rib in a panang curry with grilled broccolini, bell pepper, and blue rice. This is literally to die for. Again, I\\'ll highlight the curry, which makes this dish as it adds creaminess, flavor and spice to the beef. <br/><br/>Bonus points for a fun, well decorated atmosphere! For a second, you might almost forget that you\\'re in SF. <br/><br/>*Caveat: although I deemed Farmhouse 5 stars, I must mention that the service can be off sometimes (the staff has forgotten to put an order in, mixed up an order, etc). But, the food and atmosphere is so worth it that I couldn\\'t not give it 5 stars.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Eh this place was overrated. Good thing I made a reservation through Yelp because it was very crowded on a Friday night! Cute, modern decor and food comes out quite fast.<br/>We ordered the fried chicken and the beef shank. Huge portions! I liked the curry that came with the fried chicken but the beef shank was quite salty. Both dishes came with a scoop of pretty bluish purple rice. I tried the house soda as well and wasn\\'t a fan. It reminded me of plum juice.<br/>For dessert we ordered the Thai vacation which was vanilla ice cream served in a coconut with coconut meat and sticky rice, and requested to leave off the peanuts.<br/>Service was kind of stifling. While you ate, they were nonexistent but as soon as you look full they seemed in a rush to make you leave. While we were waiting for the bathroom and check, a waitress bluntly said to me \"A bunch of people are waiting for you to finish\". I\\'ve never experienced something that blatant in a restaurant! I get it\\'s busy but people should be able to enjoy their dinner before leaving. Not something I would try by myself again.</p>',\n",

       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Farmhouse has become one of my favorite go-to restaurants in SF. <br/><br/>My boyfriend and I always get the 24 Hour Beef Noodle Soup and the Hat Yai Fried Chicken. It kills me a little that I\\'m paying over $20 for soup that I may be able to find for a fraction of the price in an Asian restaurant, but so far I haven\\'t found a place with such great tasting noodle soup. I also am not a big fan of fried chicken in general, but I am a big fan of Farmhouse Thai\\'s! The skin on the chicken is light and crispy, not overly breaded. The curry that the chicken is served with is also really good. <br/><br/>My only gripe is that this place is not always consistent. Over the 4 or so times I\\'ve been here, I\\'ve received varying serving sizes of the chicken. On some days, they will give a lot of meat, but on other days, they will serve one smaller piece. <br/><br/>Farmhouse is always crowded during dinner time, so I recommend making a reservation in advance. When going in big groups, even with a reservation, be prepared to wait 30-40 minutes before you are actually seated. I have also visited during lunch time on the weekend, and there was no wait.</p>',\n",

Fortunately, Farmhouse didn\\'t disappoint and I\\'ve had the best Thai food experience.

You won\\'t find green curry fried rice nor Thai ice tea on the menu. My colleague, who\\'d been here already several times, highly recommended the fried chicken and so I went with that: a-mazing!<br/><br/>While I love the food, I found the service a bit nonchalant...let\\'s put it this way: I can\\'t recall any interaction with anyone from the service team.

I had a reso for 6 of us and they tried to squish us onto a 4 top next to the bathroom :( I asked for one of their larger tables in the middle of the restaurant and was told they could only do that if we left within an hour. I said we could do that as long as the food didn\\'t take forever so the clock started! After that, service was great and food did come out quickly. It wasn\\'t anything special when it came to Thai food in the city. +1 for reasonable parking in the city.</p>',\n",

We were seated promptly as they had just opened for the day. I ordered a Thai tea which is always one of my favorites. It arrived with a large scoop of crushed ice which was great. The prices are a little steep with the average tab being $15-24. Condiments are a bit pricey I\\'ve never pd $4 for peanut sauce although they give you a nice portion. Before our meal we were served pickled veggies which were nice. My coworker ordered the Thai rice with seafood but instead received the a noddle dish. The waiter quickly corrected the order. I ordered the Hat Yai chicken which was a large chicken breast deep fried, yellow curry with potato, roti and blue jasmine rice. It was a large portion and very delicious. I would suggest ordering this dish and sharing. Overall great place a little outta the way of my usual places but worth it.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">The first time we came was for lunch and we\\'re delighted that it wasn\\'t crowded and excessively loud. I think it was 3:30 on a wet Saturday.

I usually stay away from loud places because I like to talk but here is an exception. Coming here is a blast! At one point there was a guy with a cart going around to all the tables with Flank Steak appatisers. This was great because we needed a snack. <br/><br/>Have your birthday here on Saturday night; it\\'s a party! Raise your voice a little and really laugh out loud.<br/><br/>Spicey Fish Cakes - great!<br/>Green Curry with Chicken - loved it.<br/>24HR Beef Noodle Soup - wonderful.<br/>Herbal rice salad - on point.<br/><br/>Later on some street vendor looking dude balancing a funny bamboo contraption on his shoulders was serving bite size desert things. Very cool. If you\\'re looking for a place to impress your friends and family from Iowa bring them here.<br/><br/>The value here is exceptional. This is not cheap but the food is a home run. The pictures helped a lot; you can see the quality.<br/><br/>We will be back.</p>',\n",

My friend is a vegetarian, so sometimes it\\'s hard for us to eat out together, but Farmhouse made it very easy. From the delicious chicken wings to tofu stir fry, I could eat their food all day! <br/><br/>I would come here regularly if it wasn\\'t as expensive. I went to dinner with three girlfriends and it cost $35 for me without a drink. My girlfriends who got drinks paid about $50 each -- probably normal for San Francisco, but definitely not an every-week kind of thing. <br/><br/>Also, for birthdays they don\\'t give free dessert, but they will put a candle on a dessert you purchase and sing a really cool birthday song with lots of noisemakers included.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Great for groups! A rare gem in the packed city of San Francisco. <br/><br/>I\\'ve been to Farmhouse Kitchen Thai twice with a party of 5 or more and both times, it\\'s been a solid experience. Call ahead or make a reservation on Yelp and it\\'s smooth sailing.<br/><br/>One of the many things I like about this particular restaurant is their location: 20th Street Corridor. Within a short walk you\\'ve got quite a few Mission border gems like Trick Dog, The Tradesman, Atlas Cafe and Flour + Water. Totally underrated in terms of neighborhood street cred.<br/><br/>What to order? I hate when people say this at a restaurant, but you really can\\'t go wrong with most everything on the menu. Here\\'s what our seven top chowed down on a few weeks ago:<br/><br/>+ Fresh Rolls (with shrimp)<br/>+ Ahi scoops<br/>+ Crispy Calamari<br/><br/>And for an entree, I should\\'ve split the Hat Yai fried chicken, but damnit, I didn\\'t want to share. Half of the table ordered the same main dish and none of us were willing to go halfsies. And you know what? It really was everything promised: tender, flavorful, and just the right amount of spice. My tastebuds were tickled in oh, so many good ways.<br/><br/>Price per person (with automatic 20% tip with large parties) came to about $35 per person. That included apps, mains, and drinks. That\\'s a huge win in San Francisco... finding a table to fit your people and then being able to afford the experience.<br/><br/>If you like Thai food and you like visiting the Mission, go here now. What are you waiting for?</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Wow, I\\'m glad I moved over to the Potrero side of Mission and finally got to experience THE amazing deliciousness that is Farmhouse Thai! \\xa0I love everything I\\'ve gotten here. The fried chicken that\\'s featured in 50% of the Yelp pictures is delicious (but a small portion given the price), and the steak rolls appetizer is just about as amazing as steak rolls can get. \\xa0Next on the to-eat list - the 24 hour beef noodle soup!<br/><br/>Tip #1: The food is relatively pricey, even by SF standards. When I go we usually get a few dishes and split them, and it ends up being ~$25 per person (without drinks). <br/><br/>Tip #2: There is always, always a long wait. I\\'ve gone with a reservation, without a reservation, and an hour before closing, and every time I\\'ve had to wait 30+ minutes.<br/><br/>Tip #3: There\\'s a decent amount of street parking around the restaurant. You might have to circle a few times and walk a few blocks. <br/><br/>Overall: The food at Farmhouse Thai is amazing. The only reason it gets a 4-star rating instead of a 5-star rating is the consistent long wait (even with a reservation) and the expensiveness. Despite both factors, I find myself coming back and back again :)</p>',\n",

Samosas were good with yummy curry sauce, the mango salad was like a papaya salad but with mangoes! It was delicious. Just to warn yall, the mango salad is very spicy, which is how we southeast Asians love it. It was so spicy I had firecracker ass the next morning, but it was well worth it.

It had a casual relaxing vibe but not too loud. Great place for groups (if you can get a reservation). <br/><br/>The food overall was really good! I wouldn\\'t say it\\'s the most authentic or best thai place I\\'ve been to in my life but it\\'s definitely up there in the SF thai restaurant list. <br/><br/>We all loved the hat yai fried chicken entree. Must get that one! Also the neua num tok rolls appetizer was amazing. Wish we got more of those since each order only has 4 pieces. It was the perfect mixture of refreshing cucumber and grilled wagyu beef and bright flavors. <br/><br/>The crab fried rice was quite yummy also.

They have a wall of water spouts, gorgeous floral arrangements that play with sizing and scale, and they serve their bottled beer out of chalices. Everything is expertly curated, it\\'s truly a beautiful space. <br/><br/>The food is incredible, too. The menu is extensive for the size of the place and includes everything from Fried Chicken, to Pad Thai. I had a Garlic Chicken dish with Rice that was delish. They brought out spices and salsas to add to your meal that allowed you to choose your spice level. That was an awesome benefit, because even though I like a good amount of spice, I really wanted to taste the flavors of my food last night. <br/><br/>The one thing that was really spicy was the Papaya Salad. The menu mentions that it\\'s spicy, but we glossed over that.. I mean how spicy could it be? Spoiler alert: HOT HOT HOT! <br/><br/>Overall this was a great choice for a mid-week meal, make reservations though! The location is small.</p>',\n",

       "  '<p lang=\"en\">So full.<br/><br/>This was one of those times that the boyfriend had visited before me and then couldn\\'t stop talking about it. I had to try. We were starving (as usual) and ordered three main dishes... The server politely asked if we would like to switch a main to a starter. Nahh we\\'ll keep all three main dishes.<br/><br/>Hat Yai Fried Chicken (duh) $18 - I\\'ve had my fair share of fried chicken, but I\\'ve never had it \"Thai-style\" before. And I\\'ve been missing out! You have too if you haven\\'t tried it! The herbs really make the difference, and even though the curry was for the roti bread and rice, I dipped the chicken in there too. Oops. A very delicious oops.<br/><br/>24 Hours Beef Noodle Soup $18 - The meat that came with this dish, man, it was so so good. Literally falling off the bone, the meat was soft and juicy and everything I want my beef to be. Great flavors! Again, different from your \"usual\" beef noodle soups (Taiwanese or American). Honestly, I loved this more than I loved the chicken (boyfriend was aghast - nothing beats fried chicken).<br/><br/>Specials $18 - That I forgot the name of :( It was a broth of pork and blood jelly, with condiments, cilantro/sprouts, and vermicelli on the side. This was a really interesting dish, and while it wasn\\'t bad, the blood jelly overwhelmed the broth. (it also had that sticky rice taste, but there was no sticky rice in sight). Overall, interesting combination but I wouldn\\'t try it again. I have nothing against blood jelly! Definitely props to the kitchen for being adventurous with something that\\'s rare in even Asian American kitchens.<br/><br/>Loved the vibe and service. Super fun and delicious place that I can\\'t wait to visit again! And yes, we were stuffed from three dishes... but no complaints :)</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">If the cuisine at Farmhouse were any more authentic and delicious, you\\'d be in Thailand.<br/><br/>This places deserves five stars for two things:<br/>1. Atmosphere. The interior design and decor is impeccable. The large-scale floral arrangements, long wood tables and rustic accents create a truly chic dining experience. Even the restroom is gorgeous, draped with modern lighting fixtures and reclaimed wood art. (Yes, I just called a restroom gorgeous).<br/><br/>2. Food. I went with a large group of work colleagues and everyone was 100% satisfied with their menu selection. At the recommendation of Ben F., I went with the Hat Yai Fried Chicken. This colorful dish is Thai Southern style and made with Mary\\'s organic chicken breast, turmeric &amp; herbs, fried shallots roti bread, potato yellow curry for dipping and blue jasmine rice. If you\\'re not in the mood to drink, the House Soda is exceptional. Fresh lime, cane sugar and blue flower give it the most beautiful tie dyed purple hue. <br/><br/>Farmhouse is worth every second of visiting. But most importantly, call ahead in advance! The space is a refurbished schoolhouse, so with limited seating, it can fill up fast. A must try in San Francisco!</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Probably one of the most fun Thai place I\\'ve been to. <br/><br/>I\\'d like to thank the hostess for not canceling our reservation and actually giving us a call to check if we were still coming. We were running a few minutes late, and they were definitely packed. <br/><br/>Tom Kha was way way too sweet. So sweet that I didn\\'t even want more than just a spoonful. \\xa0Tom Kha is one of my favorite thai dishes, so that says a lot. <br/><br/>Pad See Ew was just average. Once again, very sweet. <br/><br/>Ahi Scoops appetizer was fantastic.<br/><br/>Tom Yum Noodle Soup was great. Although they say its spicy, it was more of a mild spice. Personally, I could have used a little more kick. But all the other flavors were great, The soup was creamy and sour and sweet, super fragrant and aromatic.</p>',\n",

We got the 24-hour beef noodle soup, the chef\\'s special, the panang curry, the samosas, and the pad thai. Everything was so delicious!!<br/><br/>The beef from the noodle soup was heaven--it was so soft and smooth. The pork belly from the chef\\'s special was also amazing.

       "  '<p lang=\"en\">I was so ready to fall in love with this place, after drooling over photos on Yelp and being wow-ed by the gorgeous ambiance of the restaurant. But this place had a lot of highs but also a a lot of lows when I came here for a group dinner for a group of 9. They do take reservations for large parties and we were able to get a dinner spot only a day in advance. They have a lot of large tables and on a Saturday night there wasn\\'t ever really a line or wait from what I saw so good if you want to skip the crazy San Francisco dinner waiting.<br/><br/>First off, the ambiance and decor here is lovely. Really open and beautiful space. I would imagine it to be a great place for a fancy or celebratory occasion! <br/><br/>Now, the most important thing - the food. Some parts were amazing. Some were not my cup of tea. Here\\'s what we ordered, sharing everything family-style:<br/>- Neua Num Tok Rolls: 4 pieces of wagyu beef that were so tender and juicy. Loved the toppings and spices it was paired with. I think this was everyone\\'s favorite dish! It is very small however, with each piece just a bite of beef really.<br/>- Thai Street Green Curry Noodles: I thought the curry was good especially when you mix the vermicelli noodles in it comes it! I\\'ve never had noodles with curry before like this so it was really good. But, it came with so little noodles that there was still soooooo much curry after we finished the noodles. The curry was too heavy and oily to eat without some sort of rice or noodles so I wish they had balanced the curry/noodle ratio better<br/><br/>- Chef specials (we ordered both offered that night): Presentation was beautiful, on this tall wooden stand, although impractical for a large group so they ended up taking that away haha.<br/>1. Beef with papaya salad and noodles with some sauce: While the beef here was really tender like the appetizer, that was the only part of the dish that was enjoyable. It came in several parts, the beef in a bowl with some vegetables, the papaya salad in another, and then the noodles. We did not enjoy the sauce and spices that came with the noodles and the papaya salad was SOOOOOO spicy without any tastiness to it. It was also not very enjoyable and no one wanted to finish it after the beef was gone. So we essentially got a dish for $25+ for just a few pieces of beef (although it was really good). Definitely felt a little bit unsatisfied with this one.<br/>2. Pork soup with noodles in a claypot: This also came in a few pieces and we added all the ingredients (noodles, toppings, etc.) into the claypot with the broth and mixed. This soup was absolutely delicious. It reminded me a lot of pho, as the broth was clear with rice noodles. This was probably our favorite entree! The only problem with splitting a dish 4-ways is each bowl was so small. We each probably got a small bowl with a few strands of noodle. Again, very little noodles came with the dish!<br/><br/>I was absolutely shocked by the small portions, especially the small portions of noodles for each dish. We did split everything 4 ways but even so, if I ordered one of the chef specials to eat by myself, I would have been disappointed at the portion for the price (each chef special was in the upper $20s). Some in our group were slightly full, some not that full, but no one was stuffed by this meal. And while I don\\'t doubt its authenticity, we were all really shocked by spice combination in the beef chef special. Besides the beef, the papaya salad and noodles just weren\\'t very appetizing and we left most of that dish untouched.<br/><br/>We ended our meal with a Thai Vacation, coconut sticky rice, with coconut and coconut ice cream! This was served in a little coconut and a little umbrella which I thought was beautiful. Tasted great as well! Definitely recommend their desserts as there were so many I wanted to try!<br/><br/>I think this place shines in its presentation and gorgeous ambiance. They also serve some really tender beef and they have very unique dishes that I have not seen at your typical Thai restaurant. However, I cannot understand the high price tags (appetizers were well over $10, entrees were $17-$25, and chef specials were upper 20s) for such small portions. And then there were some parts of our meal that were a little strange. Maybe we didn\\'t order the correct things, although I assumed chef specials should be some of a restaurant\\'s best dishes. Regardless, I am open to coming back and trying some other dishes! Have heard great things about their Hai Yai chicken and Panang Neua.</p>',\n",

My friends and I tried out several dishes that were all delicious, plated nicely, though a bit pricier than Thai restaurants in the TL that are just as tasty. Seems like many people come here for birthday celebrations where they\\'d sing and beat drums while bringing the special individual a dessert on the house. It\\'s very lively here and even at one point one of the servers was carrying snacks off the menu, such as taro roots and fried grasshoppers, in baskets from table to table for order like a street vendor. Dishes we tried were:<br/><br/>Ahi scoops - tasty and a little bit spicy<br/>Thai fish cakes - these were average<br/>Mieng Kum Kung - Yum!

It does get pricey, if you start with appetizers. Word to the wise: save space and go straight to the main dishes!<br/><br/>The menu is super long and tempting, so I suggest using Yelp photos to choose what you want. The Thai Fried Chicken was popular with our group, a huge portion of chicken with a side of curry &amp; purple rice. Share-able! The 24-hour beef noodle soup was another winner, the broth so unctuous and rich. <br/><br/>I wanted something saucy &amp; noodley, and ordered the Thai street green curry noodles. This was more like curry with a side of noodles. Still good, but definitely ask the staff questions if you\\'re craving something specific. <br/><br/>Note: the tom yum kai soup is a BIG portion to start with, with tons of chicken, light on the broth. Not the best if you just want something to savory sip on before your meal, but great as a filler-upper. <br/><br/>Ambiance is vast, like a Farmhouse, great for a group dinner of 6-8 people (or less, of course). Service was very fast and attentive to special requests. Overall, a delicious, decadent meal that was extra fun to share with fellow adventurous eaters.</p>',\n",

The fried chicken was tasty and served with a side of curry and their blue rice. And not to worry, their blue rice tastes like regular jasmine rice, but just comes in an interesting color. The penang beef rib was by far my favorite and the standout dish of the evening. It was very tasty and also nice and tender. The flavorful meat easily came off the bone. We tried the Pad Thai too, but that also tasted pretty standard and could be skipped to try something more unique on their menu.</p>',\n",

       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Hidden on a dark corner, Farmhouse Thai perhaps had held too high of expectations for me. At 8 pm with lines out the door and a packed house with a trendy interior and hip looking waiters, we eagerly waited for our table. We had a reservation for 8:15, but had friends who were late, so they wouldn\\'t seat us until everyone was there. Our friends arrived at 8:45 and then we waited sadly and hangrily as many other groups got seated before us and as the waiters arranged and rearranged and then re-rearranged other tables. \\xa0We finally got seated around 9 and ordered immediately. The papaya salad came first, and was so spicy that we left half of the dish unfinished. \\xa0The fried chicken was yummy, but everything else we ordered (minus the blue/green tinted rice) was remnant of traditional Thai fare. \\xa0Maybe I was hangry, but I was unimpressed by the food for the price.<br/><br/>This place seems like it would be good for party groups who want to share scorpion bowls. \\xa0Maybe just don\\'t be hangry like me and eat earlier.</p>',\n",

       "  '<p lang=\"en\">In a word? Delicious. <br/><br/>The title \"Farmhouse Kitchen Thai Cuisine\" perfectly describes what you\\'ll get when you sit down for a meal here: modern twists on authentic Thai meals made with fresh, farm-to-table ingredients. As far as Thai food is concerned, this was one of the better meals I\\'ve ever eaten. <br/><br/>As soon as my work group sat down and saw the menu choices, we didn\\'t hold back. Thai Fish Cakes? A selection of curries? Hat Yai Fried Chicken? Whatever we saw, we ordered. My personal favorite appetizer was the Neua Num Tok Rolls, a succulent combination of Wagyu flank steak wrapped with mint,<br/>cilantro and cucumber and served with a cilantro lime vinaigrette. I was equally happy with my main course: 24 Hours beef noodle soup. This addictive elixir includes slow cooked bone-in beef short rib, egg noodles, veal broth,<br/>broccolini, basil, bean sprouts, cilantro, green onion and pork rind garlic oil. If that sounds delicious to you then believe me it was. <br/><br/>Our server was quick and attentive and the atmosphere is pleasant if not a little noisy. I could easily return here on my frequent trips to the city, and I know it will be a recommendation to other traveling friends as well.</p>',\n",

As for the food, it\\'s got your traditional (by traditional, I mean popular in American Thai restaurants) dishes, so your curries, noodles, etc.. But it\\'s also got other unique dishes. <br/><br/>Overall, it\\'s pretty good Thai food, but definitely on the pricy side. So, definitely a place for a special occasion or a place to impress your date. I wouldn\\'t necessarily come here for a quick lunch bite as it gets quite busy. However, you can always call in your order and swing by to pick it up. <br/><br/>(34/100)</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">I loved the modern atmosphere and interesting Thai dishes here. Service was exceptionally friendly and attentive. <br/><br/>We walked in without a reservation on a weekend for a group of 4 and there was only one spot available at a small table. I\\'d definitely recommend getting a reservation beforehand. The table was a little too small and we could barely fit all the dishes we ordered on there.<br/><br/>We got the street fair baby shrimp fritters ($9) as an appetizer. I thought this was just okay and probably would try something else on the menu next time. Highlight of the meal for the entire table was the 24 hours beef noodle soup ($18). The beef was extremely tender and the veal broth was so flavorful. It is the perfect dish for cold San Francisco weather. The panang neua ($22) was tasty but if you\\'re going to get beef short rib I would go with the beef noodle soup. The pad thai ($14) was good but didn\\'t stand out to me. Really enjoyed the spicy eggplant side dish ($9). There were great garlic and basil flavors!<br/><br/>Overall excellent choice for Thai food especially if you\\'re looking for a nice dining experience.</p>',\n",

       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Pros: The atmosphere is excellent. It\\'s clear that a lot of thought went into the physical aspects of the restaurant, and the staff are well trained; quick, very friendly, and very attentive.<br/><br/>The food itself was good seemed authentic (who am I to know?), but people considering the restaurant should keep in mind that what they\\'ve had before probably won\\'t match up to what\\'ll be served here. Adjusting takes a little bit of time, but it\\'s worth it. The flavors you are used to aren\\'t as strong as they usually are, and there are new flavors and spices to try.<br/><br/>Give it a go!<br/><br/>Cons: This place almost got 5 stars. <br/><br/>What knocked it down were the insects (grasshoppers? crickets?). They offer very authentic cuisine, and part of that cuisine are the insects they offer to you as a treat while you wait. Unfortunately, they don\\'t really ask if you want it, they just serve them as if they were serving a bowl of peanuts. <br/><br/>While this isn\\'t necessarily a bad thing, where they missed the mark on customer service was the fact that the bowl followed us from the waiting area to the dining table. The fact that the bowl sat far away from the waiting party and no one so much as touched them should have been a sign.<br/><br/>Staff should probably take 30 seconds to explain what the treat being served is, and if the party is interested in them. As it was, a few people at our table lost their appetite in spite of the quality of the food.</p>',\n",

       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Went here last night (2/17) with a group of friends and was big time impressed with the food, service, and atmosphere. First off, the layout of the space was amazing and go figure, it looked like a farmhouse. :) A+ for interior design work. <br/><br/>The food was fantastic! I don\\'t eat a ton of Thai food in SF (not for any particular reason), but I\\'d put this at the top of my list. It\\'s non traditional in a Thai sense from what most of you are probably used to, but man is it good. <br/><br/>We started with the Ahi Tuna Scoops (see picture), Herbed Rice Salad (prob my favorite of the bunch), and the Neua Num Tok Rolls with a Thai chimichurri dipping sauce. All were amazingly different from each other and I would highly recommend them all. My main course was the Hat Yai Friend Chicken. Yes, I\\'m a sucker for friend chicken if you couldn\\'t tell from other posts. If it\\'s on the menu, I get it. Seriously, this was one of the best fried chickens I\\'ve had in SF and was an enormous plate of food. It comes with a bowl of curry and rice too. I opted to let the chicken sit in the curry and soak up the amazing flavors. Seriously, heaven. <br/><br/>I\\'ll surely be back with a large group of friends who are sure to be impressed. Boo ya.</p>',\n",

Our experience here was incredible. Definitely will be back to try more dishes.</p>',\n",

Both were average tasting for Thai food so I\\'d order them again if I were craving it, but it\\'s not anything I\\'d recommend.<br/>My annoyance was that I ordered a fresh coconut as my drink that never came, they didn\\'t charge us for it, but c\\'mon. Esp because they came back to tell us our original order wasn\\'t available since they were out of some ingredient or another. Isn\\'t that something you should tell the table when you take their order? Not 10 min later?<br/>The coconut dessert we got was delicious so the beginning and end of our visit were positive.

The food was pretty good, but service was not so great - we waited at least 10 minutes before anyone acknowledged us. When someone finally did, we ordered the Panang Neua (bone in short rib curry) and the Hat Yai (fried chicken with roti and potato curry dipping sauce and some sort of sweet sauce). Both were also served with blue rice, which made the dishes look really interesting, but it just tasted like normal rice. Not sure why it\\'s blue.<br/><br/>My bf thought the short rib was OK; the meat was tough and the sauce was heavy, but the broccolini was a nice touch. I thought the Hat Yai was better; the boneless fried chicken was tender and had just enough breading and the dipping sauces were flavorful. I love roti, but this roti wasn\\'t as soft as others I\\'ve had. We also ordered the \"Thai Vacation\" for dessert, which was vanilla ice cream, sesame, peanuts, coconut cream, and real shaved coconut served in an empty coconut shell. \\xa0It had a nice presentation and was delicious, but I would have preferred a more tropical ice cream flavor. All in all, a cool Thai restaurant, but I think you\\'d be paying more for the ambience than the food.</p>',\n",

The food is so good, you\\'ll want to come back several times that week. After eating at Farmhouse, I don\\'t ever \"crave\" Thai food. I crave Farmhouse.<br/><br/>Presentation &amp; Ambience: From the dishes, decor, server attire and music, Farmhouse tells you a story about Thailand. You might sit underneath a farmhouse metal awning or neatly lined rows of faucets. The table centerpiece may be a succulent sprouting from an old pipe or an elaborate floral arrangement you could only find at a Thai Temple. When you order a dish (ex: Kai Yang), your sticky rice is served in a traditional basket and your chicken is served between a pair of sticks. It\\'s an authentic experience balanced with a modern atmosphere and exquisite food.</p>',\n",

The portions were quite small, so not good for sharing. \\xa0Nothing really impressed us, especially for the price. \\xa0We had green curry, pad se ew, and the mango crab salad. <br/><br/>The other frustrating thing is that for a fairly large restaurant there was only one bathroom. \\xa0There were lines the entire time we were there, but the interior of the bathroom was ENORMOUS. \\xa0They should really consider breaking it up into tow or three smaller bathrooms to help with the lines.</p>',\n",

I don\\'t think it\\'s for everyone though due to the texture, which is very similar to Japanese kamaboko (that pink stuff that you get in a bowl of udon) or the fish balls you put in hot pot<br/>- Tom Yum Noodle Soup ($15): Good amount of seafood inside, and the broth was spicy and super flavorful. Loved that the egg noodles were cooked well, not soggy at all. The crispy wontons(?) on the side were a nice touch too.<br/>- Hat Yai Fried Chicken ($16): HIGHLIGHT of the meal! The fried chicken\\'s breading was so so amazingly crispy on the outside. And the yellow curry was the most flavorful yellow curry I\\'ve ever had. So naturally, I smothered the fried chicken, the roti, AND the blue rice with it as I was eating.<br/><br/>On top of the taste of the food, service was attentive and friendly, and the dishes had really colorful and playful presentation (aka good food Instagram material). <br/><br/>Definitely the most unique Thai meal I\\'ve ever had, and one of the tastiest!</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Score! This place met every expectation I anticipated for! I found it on yelp, made a reservation through yelp and could not wait to dine here, I really was very excited to try it out! <br/>Friday night we walked over from the office (1.6 mi. from Hayes Valley). BEWARE: Florida st and Treat is crackheads ghetto - Yikes! But it\\'s ok, me and my gal pal made it through alive! SUGGESTION: Uber it. <br/><br/>Once we walked in, it felt like we left San Francisco and entered Thailand! The host/waiters were in costume or I should say, traditional Thai attire, and they all spoke with thick Thai accents; quite authentic. (Our jaws dropped). They asked if we had a reservation and I said, yes, so they immediately seated us. The decor on the other hand was so cool, very trendy with a modern twist. There was a wall display of water faucets with red handles.. hundreds of them, visually a pretty cool concept. The decor didn\\'t seem to have any authentic Thai theme/motif, but it suited the place and I loved every inch of it. The overhead lamps looked nautical, I\\'m not sure if there is an intentional \"water\" theme of some sort, but whatever it was, it looked great! <br/><br/>Where do I begin with the food.. Ugh.. There\\'s so much to say.. As I expected everything to be delicious.. It was! We ordered all the waiters suggestions:<br/>Ahi Tuna appetizer - BEEE-U-TIFUL presentation and excellent tasting. <br/>Phai Char Shrimp - came with veggies and blue rice - Yum!<br/>Beef plate (not the beef noodle soup) - meat was so flavorful and tender it fell off the bone. Came with veggies and blue rice - perfection!<br/><br/>THEN.. came a little Thai man, in his Thai attire, carrying a pretty Thai display of Thai food. (Where has he been my whole life?!) Optional for $7 he offered a spicy red curry chicken bowl with veggies. The combination of fresh veggies was presented in a bowl made out of banana leaves to mix in with the red curry chicken). \\xa0Uhhhh.. Yes please! <br/>We gobbled that right up! <br/><br/>If there weren\\'t people around giving me dirty looks, I would have licked all the dishes clean.. ! <br/><br/>We washed everything down with a nice cold Belgium beer; much needed to cool the spice! <br/><br/>Finally, dessert.. The chocolate thingy. (I forgot the name). It\\'s the only chocolate item on the menu, served warm, you can\\'t miss it.. It\\'s so good, included vanilla ice cream! <br/><br/>We ordered a lot, bill came to $88 for 2 people including tip. I have to add, the service was exceptional, everyone was so kind and respectful, and humble I may add. <br/><br/>There, \\xa0that\\'s it, I got it off my chest.. I absolutely loved this place! Location kinda sucks, border lining the crackheads ghetto. (Further down on Florida St at the corner of Treat.) \\xa0 however, the restaurant is located in a residential area, looks as though it\\'s a new development (not sure), but street parking is available. <br/><br/>Yes, I\\'ll be back again and again and again..</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Overall, the food was good -- especially if you like Thai street food (there\\'s a section on the menus specifically labeled street food, but everything we had from other parts of the menu was also street food). Fun ambiance, but some of the wait staff was pretty brusque. They don\\'t want you to linger, and they made that clear from the start. We got a pursed mouth and a sour face when we weren\\'t ready to order right away, and we were asked to leave as soon as we paid the check because they wanted our table.

Really cool as I\\'ve never had blue rice anymore. \\xa0The waiter assured me it is only food coloring and no flavoring is added. \\xa0The chicken was a bit over cooked. \\xa0As I bit into it, it tasted really dry and not tender at all. \\xa0However all the spices in the dish were really good. \\xa0Just a shame the chicken wasn\\'t cooked right. <br/><br/>My bf had the chicken curry which was served with eggplant and bamboo. \\xa0Again a bit of a let down. \\xa0There was something off about the curry. \\xa0I can\\'t really describe it but it didn\\'t taste like how I expected it to taste. \\xa0Kind of a sharp unappealing taste. \\xa0It really is a shame since this is so close and it looks so chic inside!<br/><br/>I may give it one more try since we live so close.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">A solid 4 stars. A group of five of us came for dinner mid week and the place was packed from the time we entered to the time we left. The atmosphere is a cool mix of hawker, regular restaurant, wall full of faucets. Thai music plays \\xa0while the waiters run around wearing traditional thai long shorts/ short pants. <br/><br/>Menu isn\\'t crazy big but it is filled with a lot of interesting things with elaborate names. The problem with this is that you have to kinda translate it and edit the dish down to what is really is. Like just to describe say basically \"beef\" it says \"Grilled Snake River Farm Wagyu Flank Steak\" so you get kinda like \"wait what i\\'m getting snake from a river farm grilled?\" for half a second. I hate it when things use too many words to describe things. That drives me nuts. So after translating the menu, we decided to order the following: <br/><br/>Mieng Kum Kung - which is fried prawns on top of some delicious crunchy things on top of a leaf. Gorgeous and delicious dish. <br/>Thai Sausage - good but a little boring - just sliced up sausages on top of some cucumber slices. <br/>Tom Yum Soup - super spicy and flavorful. Very delicious but nothing unusual. <br/>Beef Salad<br/>Pork Belly Salad - Both were amazing and we were all sweating with smiles on our faces while eating it. It was so spicy but so crazy flavorful. It was served with slices of plain cabbage which made a perfect compliment to the fatty meats in savory spicy sauce. <br/>Hat Yai Fried Chicken - Fried chicken was good - no bones, comes with a curry on the side and special blue rice - not sure what makes it blue or why it\\'s \\xa0blue but it\\'s got a different taste than regular rice and it was delicious. <br/>Thai Street Green Curry Noodles - Kinda boring and disappointing. It sounded a lot better than what actually showed up which was a bland green curry, and some noodles on the side. It also had a bunch of raw vegetables on the side. <br/><br/>After having the super flavorful beef salad and pork belly salad and soup- the two entrees seemed really bland and overall didn\\'t taste like much. <br/><br/>A surprise element was kinda like dim sum service where a waitress came around and asked us if we wanted small dishes. Of course we wanted off the menu daily dishes and they were a fantastic choice. The first surprise dish was a spicy sausage salad, just some small sausage slices with lettuce and chilis and onions. So good that we ended up ordering more at the end of our meal to end on a spicy note. The second dish that came around was grasshoppers. I\\'d highly recommend them. They are a great source of protein and they\\'re just tasty crunchy snack. It\\'s a little weird to see their heads but whatever. <br/><br/>For dessert we had the Thai Vacation - half a coconut filled with a black sticky rice, vanilla ice cream, and topped with coconut cream. Not only beautiful presentation but delicious. They also had a dessert option for 2-4 people. Looked like a chef\\'s choice of desserts that they said was very instagram worthy - so I applaud them for their sale description because they know what\\'s important to the people (IG worthy or not). <br/><br/>The overall experience was fantastic from start to finish.</p>',\n",

I was so blown away by the intense and delicious flavors of the soup, couldn\\'t get enough. I was also sick, and this totally hit the spot.

I can\\'t say my second experience was even close to the first. I ordered the Hat Yai Fried Chicken and friend ordered Phad Thai. The Phad thai didn\\'t have much flavor and the fried chicken was extremely greasy and didn\\'t hold the breading. I did however, admire the pretty blue rice. The curry it came with was delicious, and was a little sad at the inconsistency of flavors across dishes. <br/><br/>Well, at least I know what to order next time! <br/><br/>Both my experiences here have been with delivery and both times the driver called and asked me to come downstairs instead of bringing it up and no forks, knives, or napkins were included.

I suggest going with a group and sharing so you can taste a variety :)<br/><br/>Some of my fave dishes to order:<br/><br/>24hr beef noodle soup (4/5) - Slow cooked bone-in Beef Short Rib with egg noodles. SO GOOD. Very flavorful and leaves you wanting more with each bite.<br/><br/>Crab Fried Rice (4/5) - Great dish to share with a group. Chunks of sweet crab. Served with a side of chicken broth.<br/><br/>Grilled River Prawns Pad Thai (4/5)- I\\'m a sucker for pad thai and pad see ew. But this pad thai has such a great balance of the sweetness and slight sourness. <br/><br/>Hat Yai Fried Chicken (5/5) - My fave dish here. It\\'s like fried chicken and roti and rice. How could I say no? So tasty! The chicken is always moist and fried perfectly.</p>',\n",

My go-to dish is the Hat Yai Fried Chicken, the crispy chicken satisfies my craving every single time. Recently ordered the 24 hour beef noodle which was too savory and too salty for my liking -- that I would not get again. <br/><br/>Come here if you\\'re looking for an alternative Thai experience with the option of selecting from a wide menu, including the regular Thai street dishes (Pad Thai, Pad See Ew, etc.). The drinks are excellent too, especially the ginger milk tea.</p>',\n",

It rivals Burma Superstar\\'s tea leaf salad and the Souvla\\'s chicken salad as the best salads I\\'ve had in the city.<br/><br/>Very cool atmosphere with fun lights, cool cocktails (including a giant ceramic punch bowl with massive neon straws) birthday songs, and a bunch of fun stuff all over the walls and on the tables.<br/><br/>Strongly recommend you get a reservation.

       "  '<p lang=\"en\">I was reminded of that Seinfeld episode with Jerry trying to fulfill his car reservation: <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2F4T2GmGSNvaM&amp;s=97b30ee2b61c8985d00ad8c9eab8cb691f0dd9e40d1db8aee0ae6109c3e29d99\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">youtu.be/4T2GmGSNvaM</a>. It goes like this:<br/><br/>Agent: Sorry we have no mid-size available at the moment<br/>Jerry: I don\\'t understand, I made a reservation, do you have my reservation?<br/>Agent: Yes, we do, unfortunately we ran out of cars<br/>Jerry: But the reservation keeps the car here! That\\'s why you have the reservation!<br/>Agent: I know why we have reservations<br/>Jerry: I don\\'t think you do. If you did, I\\'d have a car. See, you know how to take the reservation, you just don\\'t know how to HOLD the reservation and that\\'s really the most important part of the reservation, the holding. Anybody can just take them!<br/><br/>That\\'s kinda what happened to us on a Friday night here. Made an 8:15 reservation, we get there and there\\'s no host and a bunch of people waiting around Wait 10 mins until we finally get attention from someone, and we\\'re asked to wait another 10-15 minutes. Wait? What? This where I go \"I don\\'t understand, I made a reservation, do you have my reservation?\" and they say something like: \"Yes, we do, unfortunately we ran out of tables.\"<br/><br/>I mean what\\'s the point of treating reservations like a wait list. Reservations are part of delivering someone a good experience because let\\'s face it, waiting sucks. I made a reservation because I don\\'t wanna wait almost half hour for a table.<br/><br/>Anyway, after that whole ordeal the service was fine from there although it seemed like a lot of other people were also waiting around to get there reservations fulfilled so I\\'m inclined to believe this happens a lot.<br/><br/>What I love about this place though is the ambiance. The decor really sets the mood. It\\'s a bit loud but that\\'s kinda the point. \\xa0They also have people coming around serving various exotic Thai snacks. This is when I tried fried grasshoppers for the first (and last!) time.<br/><br/>Plating was pretty nice and made everything feel authentic. The food was generally good but I can\\'t say it\\'s much better than your typical goto Thai joint that\\'s probably half the price of this. I got the Fried Chicken with curry dipping sauce. Curry great, chicken mediocre.<br/><br/>Would like to give this place another shot and try more of their dishes but it\\'s hard to justify the wait (even with a reservation) for, like I said, food that isn\\'t much better than nearby cheaper options.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Dined with 4 people on a very busy Thursday night. Seated us as quickly as they could despite us and many other groups not booking in advance. I had the salmon which was lovely but I hade massive food envy from my mum who had the yellow Thai curry and my brother who had the thom yum soup. All enormous portions. Brilliant atmosphere good customer service although a little mechanical and uninterested. Excellent value for money and a great reason to have a wonder round what seemed to be a lovely neighbourhood.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Since the first time I came to Farmhouse Kitchen it became my favorite Thai spot in San Francisco. I first came here on a date night, and it was super fun since they had part of the staff performing and dancing. I also loved their street food offerings. My favorite dishes on the menu are:<br/><br/>- Panang Curry<br/>- Samosas<br/>- Herbal Salad<br/>- Ahi scoops<br/><br/>Definitely try to get reservations every time you plan to eat here; otherwise expect to wait long, especially during the weekends.

Cozy Thai place with cool decor and an old school sewing machine upfront. Our server and staff was friendly. We had a little bit of everything. Pork Belly Salad was very delish. Pork cooked perfectly. Chicken wings and Thai sausage was flavorful. It went well with the sticky rice and dark chili paste which tasted homemade. Our mouths were on fire but it was so good we couldn\\'t stop eating. We had the Pad see ew, crispy Roti and the Thai fish cake. ALL WAS AMAZING and tastey. Authentic taste and the right amount of heat. I tried the Thai-Chelada but wasn\\'t my cup of tea. I will definitely be making a trip back.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Because the reservation was full at the dinner section, we went there earlier, about 3:30 PM on Saturday. And there were only about 10~12 customers dining. No need to wait. Wow, how lucky we were! The weather was good, the environment was bright, and people there were all with the great smile. Such a relaxed atmosphere that I would recommend people who like to take dinner earlier just come here. \\xa0<br/><br/>We had 2 special: Neua Yang Steak &amp; Panang Neua, and 1 classical Thai tea. The steak in medium rare tasted good, and the sauce was worthy to try for people who love to explore new flavors--the combination could give you some new inspiration. And, I really like the ginger rice with the steak. It was not too hard nor too soft, just right. \\xa0<br/>As to the Panan Neua, I love it! Although it was really a big size for me that I could only finish about half of it, I still couldn\\'t stop. When those multi vegetables went with the super delicious curry sauce and the hashed sweet potato, not only the flavor but also the texture became a nice balance as a whole. In spite that the blue rice looked good but not a too surprising taste, I was still conquered by this entrée. <br/>By the way, their Thai tea smells good. It seems like certain distinctive herbal added. However, it is still too sweet for me. But, after all, a really nice experience to dine here. Recommend!<br/><br/>慕名而來，我們沒訂到晚上的位子，於是提前下午來試試。大約三點半抵達，客人不多，完全不用等待，用餐感覺也格外清爽、悠閒，非常推薦想在下午用餐的人此時前來！<br/><br/>我們點了Neua Yang Steak和Panang Neua(short rib)兩個主餐，牛排醬料確實帶有泰式香料獨特的風味，搭配起來頗感新鮮，牛排附的薑飯口感微硬，烹煮得剛剛好。short rib份量相當大！但搭配的咖哩醬非常美味，加上底下鋪墊著洋蔥、甜椒、青花菜等豐富的蔬菜，以及地瓜小炸塊增添口感，好吃得讓人幾乎停不下來！雖則藍色的飯，嚐起來不如視覺上來得驚喜；他們家的泰式奶茶，對我來說，也還是太太太太甜了...不過，整體而言，還是非常推薦唷！</p>',\n",

Fresh Rolls / Summer Rolls/ Spring Rolls / whatever you want to call them with the fresh ricepaper wrapper. They\\'re amazing. <br/>2. HAT YA FRIED CHICKEN. It\\'s amazing. I was super dubious of what type of \\'fried chicken\\' this would be... I don\\'t eat chicken off the bone and I\\'m not a fan of most fried chicken. LUCKILY the chicken here are two really flavorful, moist (I hate that word too), chicken breast fillets. They\\'re breaded with something and stacked on top of one another with some roti, amazing massaman curry in a bowl and delicious blue sticky rice. This meal is out of this city. Definitely give it a go. Everything complements one another perfectly. <br/>3. Green Curry. Yeaaa, it\\'s pretty good. I\\'d say the two items before are the ones to go for though. <br/><br/>IF YOU\\'RE LOOKING FOR FOOD, EAT HERE.<br/><br/>The only downside of this place is that I can\\'t find any app that delivers from here :\\'(</p>',\n",

I also ask if I can order in advance, I know staff might not want to serve last minute customers. But he say he cannot they can only do Togo in advance. So I told him that I\\'m on my way, i will try my best to make it earlier. But there might be traffic. He told me to drive faster and nothing else he can do. I would suggest to change your business hour to 1:30 instead of 2:00. This is so ridiculous. I hope the management level read this and take action.

Also got the yellow curry dinner which was good though I\\'ll probably try a different curry next time as it was maybe a little boring for my personal tastes.

Mushrooms aplenty! 4 stars. <br/>-- hat yai friend chicken: seemed like two separate dishes in one; roti &amp; curry dipping sauce doesn\\'t go with fried chicken breast cutlets, IMO, but I was happy to try a bit of everything. Blue rice looked funky, but tasted like regular white rice. 3 stars. <br/>-- yeua yang steak: didn\\'t try the wagyu flank steak (as it was too fatty/bloody for me), but I ate more than the lion\\'s share of the spicy garlic long beans -- 4 stars for those. <br/>-- pad thai with huge grilled shrimp: thankfully not too sour, as other pad thai tend to be. 3.5 stars <br/><br/>Large portions; bright, lively atmosphere; would bring someone here who needs a break from dark, grungy hole-in-the-wall type places for the sheer novelty, but I\\'m not convinced they\\'d be converted.</p>',\n",

A lot like Vietnamese coffee density. <br/><br/>Fried chicken wings.. Sticky, savory, sweet. <br/><br/>Hat Yai Fried Chicken: I had no idea this was their most popular dish when I ordered it. Elegant crisp breading, juicy chicken breast with a savory sweet sauce. It also came with pieces of roti to dip into the lovely yellow curry potatoes.

The ambiance is a little nicer than your average Thai restaurant, but not too fancy. <br/><br/>I started off with the Thai cooler - lager and pineapples and it was so good and refreshing! <br/><br/>We got the mango salad, which is super spicy and really not worth it if you can\\'t handle spice (which is me). \\xa0We asked for dressing on the side and they literally came with a plate of shredded mangoes and cabbage with a huge bowl of dressing on the side. <br/><br/>We got the beef noodle soup and the beef was so tender and fell right off the huge bone! It was so good! the soup was flavorful and not too salty and the noodles were cooked perfectly! This noodle soup dish was HUGE and can be shared among at least 2 people. Probably the best thing I ate here!<br/><br/>We also got the Yat Kuan (?) fried chicken and it was SO good. the chicken was so juicy and not too fried. it also comes with some yellow curry and roti bread which was also good. Dipping the fried chicken in the yellow curry was bomb. and then it came with blue rice. i\\'ve never seen blue rice before so that was really cool! it tastes like regular rice..<br/><br/>We also got yellow curry with pork which i guess was a little bit of a waste since the fried chicken came with a goood portion of yellow curry. the yellow curry was really good though and i would highly recommend it. <br/><br/>We also got the pad thai which was normal pad thai and nothing special so if you aren\\'t feeling adventurous this is also a solid choice. <br/><br/>Overall, for a party of 4 it came out to be about $35 a person with everyone getting 1 drink. Pretty reasonable for the amount of food that we got!</p>',\n",

So good.<br/>* Herbal Rice Salad - 3.5 stars: If you like Burmese tea leaf salad you would love their take which includes purple, herbal rice. It was a little too sweet for me, but a must-order for first timers.<br/>* Panang Neua (short rib) - 4 stars: Fall off the bone tender, and great flavor. Note: The beef still has some structure, but I enjoyed it still.<br/>* Beef Noodle Soup (short rib soup) - 4 stars: Soup version of panang neua (so choose one or the other).<br/>* Coconut dessert - 5 stars: Fresh coconut served with sticky rice. MY GOD. So fresh and so good, and I don\\'t even like fresh coconut much. <br/><br/>Pretty Good:<br/>* Bacon wrapped Scallop - 3.5 stars: Good, juicy, and bigger than other places. A little pricey though at about $3/pop. <br/>* Thai Crispy Rolls - 3.5 Stars: Clear noodles in egg roll format. Good, but could be more flavorful. Would get again.<br/>* Spicy Eggplant Side 3.5 stars: Good, but standard. <br/><br/>Pass on These:<br/>* Chicken Satay - 2 stars: Dry, served with sauce that tastes straight up like peanut butter. Liked the roti.<br/>* Kai Yang (BBQ chicken) - 2 stars: Pros: smokey, comes with papaya salad and sticky rice. Cons: Sticky rice seemed under-cooked. Chicken was dry and mushy at once, didn\\'t like the flavor. $18!<br/>* Tom Yum - 3 stars: Pretty average flavor.

The chicken it came with was extremely dry. As dry as chicken can get... paired with sticky rice and a side of what I think was vinegar? Dry, flavorless chicken with dry rice. Not good. Maybe the papaya salad will save the dish? Not really. It didn\\'t taste fresh at all. Like the papaya had been sitting in its dressing for days. Overall just not worth the price. Maybe we ordered the wrong dishes. If you come here just order whatever is most popular.</p>',\n",

Great for groups, easy to make a reservation), and I would find any excuse to come here again in a heartbeat! Tonight, maybe? Highly likely. Great every time.<br/><br/>If it\\'s your first time, I recommend sharing for two: Herbal Rice Salad to start (maybe an order of Thai crispy rolls or samosas too, both yum), definitely the Hat Yai Fried Chicken to share, and the mango sticky rice for dessert (mmm). Get a Thai iced coffee / tea or Whole Young Coconut too!<br/><br/>More detail:<br/>**Hat Yai Fried Chicken 5/5 - Must-order. The crispiest, juiciest fried chicken ever. Not too heavy, and comes with a little bit of everything delicious: cucumber salad, yellow potato curry, roti, and blue saffron rice! Pretty large portion, so it can easily be shared between two if you order an app or two as well.<br/>**Herbal Rice Salad 4/5 - Highly recommend trying this if you like Burmese tea leaf salads. This is almost like a Thai version of that. Great mix of textures and flavors! Love the crunch.<br/>**24 Hours Beef Noodle Soup 4/5 - Delicious, flavorful broth, and the short rib meat falls off the bone<br/>**Starters: Crispy Thai rolls 3/5, Samosa 3/5</p>',\n",

       "  '<p lang=\"en\">This place is all sizzle and no steak. I really really wanted to like it because all of the food photos on Yelp looked AMAZING here, but the flavors just fell flat for me. If this review was just about presentation, then this place gets 5 stars. If you\\'re into the flavorful, pungent food that you can find on the streets of Bangkok or even at a nice resort in Phuket then this place will be a disappointment. <br/><br/>IS A RESERVATION NEEDED?<br/>It was quite busy on a Friday night. I saw groups of people waiting, so make a reservation at least a day ahead of time if you want to be seated during quickly prime dinner time.<br/><br/>HOW WAS THE SERVICE?<br/>Very fast. Food came within 10 minutes of ordering.<br/><br/>ATMOSPHERE<br/>Hipster, clean, and modern with a few Thai touches.<br/><br/>PRESENTATION OF FOOD<br/>Lovely. Every dish looked like a work of art. You\\'re basically paying a premium on the food for plating.<br/><br/>TASTE OF FOOD<br/>Everything we ordered felt a little bland. I could tell that the ingredients were fresh, but in terms of flavor, nothing popped and made me yearn for more.<br/><br/>BEST DISH: Rice salad - gingery, coconut-y, mango-y, crunchy goodness!!<br/><br/>JUST OK DISH: BBQ Chicken - Not bad. The chicken was tender, but not worth $18!! The plate that it came on was impressively big, but it was really just 2 pieces of BBQ chicken, a bowl of purple rice, and a tiny little papaya salad.<br/><br/>THE MEH I WOULD NOT ORDER AGAIN DISH: 24 Hour Beef Noodle Soup - We were wowed by the giant hunk of meat that came with the noodles. We were even more impressed when my boyfriend picked up the giant hunk of meat and the bone came right off. Thinking that we were in for a tender, melt-in-your-mouth beef experience, we felt cheated when the short rib turned out to be stringy, chewy, and on the tough side. When I eat Asian food, I expect my meat to be fatty, juicy, gelatinous, and soft...so this did not measure up to my standards. The broth was good but lacked punch. The egg noodles used were not the kind that picked up the flavors of the soup, and just tasted...well...eggy.<br/><br/>I would give this place another shot though. I might come back to try some Thai staples, like pad thai and crab fried rice.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Yes, the rice is supposed to be blue, and yes, you will be waiting for a long time to get a table, but the food is great. Their red curry has some serious punch to it.

The place was unbelievably packed. The ambiance was fun, light, and festive. Our server was helpful and knowledgeable-- we asked about the most popular dishes on the menu. We tried two appetizers and four entres. Every single dish was amazing. Flavorful (authentic flavors on fusion dishes), varied, fresh. The little touches- the decorative veggies, the blue rice and the small flowers- were all very authentic Thai details. <br/><br/>I really enjoyed everything. The wine was great, the food couldn\\'t have been better and most of all, all of my friends loved it. It was exactly the experience I was looking for. Thank you!</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">How come I\\'ve never been here before?! What a fun Thai restaurant. <br/><br/>I went for the first time this evening with two friends and really enjoyed not only the food but also the ambiance! I noticed that the back wall was decorated with what seemed like at least 50 sink faucets!! The staff were all dressed in Hawaiian shirts, some even with fun eye makeup and hair-- definitely a quirky crew. For a Wednesday evening, it was well packed. <br/><br/>We ordered the popular Hat Yai Fried Chicken, Thai Street Green Curry Noodles, Chicken Noodle Soup, Pad Cabbage, and Taro and Black Sticky Rice. (Note that the portions are on the generous side. For three petite girls, three main dishes meant lots of leftovers!) <br/><br/>I ordered the Fried Chicken dish, and it was absolutely delicious! Super juicy and the batter was very nicely done -- \\xa0a thin, crispy layer that tasted freshly fried! It came with roti bread on top, blue rice (not sure if this is authentic, but definitely trendy), and a bowl of yellow curry. Wow, was that satisfying. The cabbage was decent, nothing super special. Though I didn\\'t try the Green Curry Noodles or the Chicken Noodle Soup, both of my friends thoroughly enjoyed their dishes. From what I heard, the soup was definitely on the spicy side...and if you\\'re adventurous, try the blood jelly in the Green Curry Noodles (which didn\\'t have a super distinct flavor but gave me goosebumps thinking about what I was eating). Our waiter brought out a huge apron for my friend who ordered the Green Curry Noodles, apparently everyone who orders that dish has to wear the special apron, lol. The Taro Sticky Rice was a pleasant finish, which came with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and coconut flakes. The sticky rice had a surprising, smoky flavor to it. It was wrapped in banana leaves and perhaps heated over a grill/charcoal. <br/><br/>After we finished our meal, we noticed a waiter walking around with a large basket...of grilled insects! Yes, grasshopper and some type of silver worm. Appetizer/dessert anyone?<br/><br/>Haha, I definitely will be telling my friends about this place. Hope to be back soon.</p>',\n",

The calamari was outstanding and consisted of battered curry Monterrey squid, paired with a remarkable cilantro lime sauce. The Dungeness crab in the crab fried rice - was abundant and the moist rice was seasoned superbly and came neatly wrapped up in a lotus leaf beside free-range chicken broth.<br/><br/>Farmhouse Kitchen excels at manifesting quality innovative dishes with quality and local ingredients.

The fried rice was some of the BEST I\\'ve had with generous amounts of crab meat. The Fried chicken was a little heavily breaded for my liking BUT still delicious with honey and panang curry. For me it was like 2 meals in one: fried chicken and honey then panang curry + roti + blue rice. Also I\\'ve never had blue rice before. We made reservations via Yelp which was definitely the way to go since the restaurant was packed!</p>',\n",

Plus the place looks nice and the servers\\' uniforms are cute so I said what the hey, let\\'s do this. <br/><br/>we started off with the ahi scoops. four small bites come in an order. they were DELICIOUS. the combination of flavors and textures was perfect. (i added some chili peppers because i live on the dangerous side like that)<br/><br/>then we had chicken pad see ew which was DELICIOUS. the flavor was almost smokey, everything was cooked just right, it was the best pad see ew I had had in over a decade. <br/><br/>we also had the spicy tom yum soup which was equally DELICIOUS, if a bit salty (which I like). I made the mistake of thinking it was ok to drink all of the broth despite acknowledging how salty it was (because... yum). <br/><br/>have you ever done the master-cleanse fast? each morning for that fast you are supposed to do a salt water cleanse by drinking a liter of super salty water which makes you have explosive diarrhea to cleanse you. well that\\'s pretty much what it was like to eat all of that soup. <br/><br/>I\\'m still giving it four stars because the flavors were so good that I\\'ll go back though. <br/>glutton for punishment? <br/>maybe<br/><br/>hard-core spicy /salty thai food fan?<br/>definitely</p>',\n",

It is hard to find a spot, but we just drove around the area twice and found one eventually.<br/><br/>The restaurant gets really packed on the weekend.

Next time! <br/><br/>FOOD: Love the presentation! It gives off a farm vibe with rice in a weaved basket and grilled chicken between sticks and salad in a bowl. This was for the Tum Som Chicken Chef Special $18. Rice was a little too clumpy and hard for my taste. But chicken was pretty good - the thigh was nice and moist whereas the breast was on the drier side. Neither of us were fans of the sauce and the salad was a tad too spicy for me (I don\\'t take spicy too well). <br/>Panang Curry $10 - we got this with crispy slices of bread instead of rice. Decent portion, but the spice for the basil was too overpowering for my taste. It took away from the panang side of the dish a little. But if you love powerful spice, you would like this! They also have complimentary sweet potato chips! <br/><br/>SERVICE: Pretty tentative &amp; friendly service <br/><br/>AMBIANCE: The building reminds me of a farm x warehouse kinda vibe with hipster x traditional thai decorations. They have a bar on the side and the kitchen is visible through glass windows. Seat are a tad tight, but not enough to be a bother. Really cute place for a date night too!</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Farmhouse Kitchen is a surprisingly authentic and delicious Thai restaurant in the less-traversed part of the Mission. I gathered a bunch of friends here for dinner Saturday night.<br/><br/>First of all, the plates are YUGE. Good luck finishing one yourself unless you have a big appetite. Most of my friends ended up splitting two dishes, which ended up being the smart thing to do. We also split some appetizers: Thai fish cakes and calamari with cilantro lime sauce. Enjoyed these, but nothing too special. I\\'d recommend skipping the appetizers since the entrees are so filling.<br/><br/>The Hat Yai ($18) seems to be the most popular dish here, and it did not disappoint. The chicken was so flavorful and roti bread was perfect for dipping into the curry. The blue rice was a bit novel but didn\\'t actually taste too different than white rice. While I loved the 24-hour beef noodle soup ($18) with slow cooked bone-in beef short rib and veal broth, I do wish there were more egg noodles. The short rib was unbelievable. Both entrees were really solid!<br/><br/>The restaurant itself is trendy as hell and roomy enough for large groups. In fact, there was a table of 20+ people sitting behind us! However, it\\'s very popular on weekends, so get here early or make a reservation.</p>',\n",

There was absolutely no parking for blocks in radius and we were JUST about to give up and go somewhere else when a car pulled out right in front of the restaurant and we were able to snag the spot! Inside is bigger than it looked on the outside, with nice decor and a shiny stone wall on one side where the bar is. The place was fairly packed and parties waiting by the door to get their seats. Luckily we made an advanced reservation and waited only 10 minutes. This place is very loud, casual dressing, mostly white collar people wanting to relax after a long week. <br/>I ordered the panang curry with seafood combo, with the famous blue jasmine rice plus extra roti bread, that was crispy and fresh pan fried. Reminds me of a green onion pancake without the green onions. The flavor of the curry was strong, sweet and spicy, embedded with calamari, shrimp, pieces of tender fish fillet (tilapia?), chopped red peppers and fresh basil leaves. I drank it up. The rice tastes normal, just blue, so no hesitation needed if you got it and didn\\'t know what to expect.<br/>The boyfriend ordered a tom yum noodle soup with seafood as well. Same types of seafood as mine, flavorful broth and he ate all the noodles! So I think he liked it. :)<br/>Oh yeah they also gave us pickled radish and carrots, sweet and sour, like Vietnamese style.<br/>There was also a man carrying two dishes on a stuck on his back, offering free samples of something but we were too full at the end of our meal to try. It\\'s a fun plus to have though.<br/>Overall, I enjoyed the experience. It truly reminds me of Kitchen Story, with the menu it offered, but just a way bigger and louder crowd. If the parking wasn\\'t so bad, I\\'d be inclined to come back, but I have to stick with Kitchen Story since it\\'s much closer and more intimate.</p>',\n",

I went to Farmhouse as a party of 2 and we were immediately seated in the bar area even during the dinner peak rush (it also helps to call in). The waitress was helpful in explaining the menu and explained what the most popular dishes were.<br/><br/>We ended up ordering the Fried Chicken and the Beef noodle soup. The fried chicken turned out to be too dry to eat by itself and the small side \"salad\" turned out to be too spicy to enjoy, I typically enjoy spicy food but there was too much pepper to enjoy the salad properly. The noodles turned out to be a good choice, the meat melted off the bone as we were picking it apart. Eventually due to the spice, we ordered the thai iced tea which was by far the best Thai iced tea I ever had before. However, it was a shame that it costs $5 for each tea and it was half ice.<br/><br/>I would recommend getting the soup and a thai iced tea.</p>',\n",

       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Very disappointed with my visit. I felt cheated when I ordered the \"Crab Fried rice\" for $20. I was expecting to have crab in the fried rice. NOPE. The ONLY crab I saw was the few pieces (3 small pieces) that was used as garnish on top of the fried rice. The fried rice also came with a crab seasoned soup and two sides of dipping sauces. I was not happy with paying $20 for rice and eggs.<br/><br/>The Thai sausage we ordered was very good, but with a price tag of $8 for just one sausage (about 6 pieces), the \\'$\\' signs quickly washed away the flavorful taste.<br/><br/>My final dish was the Herb Salad. I\\'ve never had anything like it before and I have to say, it was great !! Perfect combination of herbs, spices, peanuts and rice in one dish. It truly leaves you feeling refreshed and satisfied. <br/><br/>Go for the Herb Salad, skip the crab fried rice, but if you like paying $20 for a bowl of rice and scrambled eggs, then be their guest.</p>',\n",

There were 2 pieces of potatoes in some curry dish we got. Not authentic tom yum with hot water and chili only. Beef flavoring of the padseeew so bland.<br/><br/>Seriously, the worst food and experience ever! Only thing decent was the service.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">FUN. We were greeted warmly and entertained the entire night by the lively and festive atmosphere. Hip, inviting interior and vibe. Food choices ranged from solid to very good: Pad Thai could have been better-- overcooked to point where veggies were a bit mushy and tofu rubbery/dried out. But our steak and chicken dishes were flavorful and presentation was fun -- loved the blue rice. And food came out *fast.* Actually feels a bit like an Asian street market with the long communal tables, blingy lights.</p>',\n",

I thought that for the price you are paying, the dishes are actually quite small. The cool part - that blue rice. I got the penang curry and to me, it definitely tasted like a red curry. It wasn\\'t bad, just not the best I have had.<br/><br/>Would I give this place a second shot? Definitely! If you\\'re in the area and are looking for some thai cuisine, check it out.<br/><br/>They also have tons of dishes for vegetarians - another plus!</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">I used to think all Thai restaurants were pretty much the same. But that all changed when I dined at Farmhouse Kitchen last night.<br/><br/>Sure, this restaurant offers the usual Thai suspects (curries, noodles, Tom Kah, papaya salad, etc.). However, what makes Farmhouse Kitchen stand out is their unusual menu offerings. I\\'m talking about dishes like Ahi Tuna Scoops, the Neua Num Tok Rolls (Grilled snake river farm wagyu flank steak wrapped with mint, cilantro, cucumber served with cilantro lime vinaigrette), and the Herbal Rice Salad (made with toasted coconut, peanuts, shredded green mango, crispy shallots, lemongrass, cilantro, sliced long beans, chili, kaffir lime, dried shrimp with tamarind dressing). And those are just the starters!<br/><br/>For my main course, I ordered the much-Yelped-about Hat Yai Fried Chicken (crispy chicken breast seasoned with turmeric and herbs, and served with fried shallots roti bread, and potato yellow curry for dipping. This dish more than lived up to its hype in both presentation and taste. My dining companions feasted on the Panang Curry Chicken, the 24 Hours Beef Noodle Soup (slow cooked bone-in beef short rib, egg noodles, veal broth, broccolini, basil, bean sprouts, cilantro, green onion and house pork fat garlic oil), and the Mekong Fish Cakes (White fish, fresh kaffir lime, red curry paste, sliced long bean served with cucumber peanut relish). Everything was beautifully plated and fan-freakin-tastic. Although I\\'m not much of a beer drinker, a bottle of Singha was the perfect way to balance the Thai spices.<br/><br/>Service was friendly and attentive. Given how busy the restaurant was, I was surprised by how quick the food came out. This kitchen is a smooth running culinary assembly line. They clearly know what they\\'re doing.<br/><br/>Although we sampled a variety of dishes, we barely scratched the surface. I can\\'t wait to come back and explore more of this eclectic menu.</p>',\n",

       "  '<p lang=\"en\">This place helps you unleash a new dimension of taste with thai food (Well, I\\'m a little biased considering I love thai food). I had the green curry which was spectacular and good portions, as I expected it to be. The pad see ew however, I am not normally a fan of given that it\\'s generally oily and not as flavorful as I hope for Thai food to be. But, Farmhouse seems to have figured out a way to flip over the pad see ew hater in me to quite the other extreme. One thing to watch out for is the spice levels. Whatever you imagine the spice level to be, this is a level higher.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Such an awesome spot! I would say hands down some of my favorite Thai food that I have eaten outside of Thailand. We started the meal with young coconuts which I thought was neat. We all certainly got our fill of tasty coconut water. The appetizer selection was impressive, I would have eaten almost everything on it! The beef rolls were so, so, good. The beef melted in your mouth and the sauce they put on it was fantastic.<br/><br/>For my main dinner I went with the fried chicken. The presentation of the dish alone was really impressive. The dish was great and the curry dipping sauce that came with it really complimented the fried chicken well. The dish was huge and could have easily been shared by two people. The blue rice was tasty, just your standard rice.<br/><br/>Now on to the piece de resistance, the dessert tray. It was my birthday and they put a candle in it which I always appreciate. The desserts were soooo good. I am a sucker for mango sticky rice so that was great. I also loved the coconut ice cream that had sticky rice hidden underneath. <br/><br/>The staff was so friendly and accommodated our large party without one snafu. Highly recommend Farmhouse Kitchen Thai.</p>',\n",

I came in with a few colleagues for dinner, we made a reservation but the restaurant was pretty quiet on a Tuesday night. <br/><br/>We started the meal with a few appetizers. The oysters were fresh and yummy, the deep fried shrimp was also good. <br/>As a main I ordered a pad Thai - I know, kinda boring, but it\\'s my favorite. I just came home from a trip to Thailand and this Pad Thai was pretty authentic, portion was pretty big and after having the appetizers sharing this dish between two people was ideal. <br/>One of my colleagues ordered the green curry, when I tried I was a bit food jealous it\\'s very yummy. <br/><br/>They have beers from Southeast Asia and a few cocktails. I would gladly come back for some more.</p>',\n",

       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Really, really delicious new Thai place in the Mission. But be warned, you\\'re probably going to spend around $30 if you order food and drinks. (Worth it, at least every now and then.)<br/><br/>One thing to immediately notice is the decor, which is kind of modern and hipster. There\\'s one wall that is pretty distinct which is entirely covered with sprinkler heads (no idea where they got them). Definitely not your typical Thai place decor. They also have really huge single bathrooms, which are kind of overkill. (In the words of my coworker, \"I think the reason why we have a housing problem in SF is these gigantic bathrooms.\")<br/><br/>In any case, the food is fantastic. I\\'ve ordered the Mok Salmon and the Panang Neua (braised short rib), both of which feature incredibly juicy and tender meats that are served with flavorful sauces and soft blue rice. I\\'m a big fan of the blue rice, but willing to admit that it may just be the blueness tricking me into thinking that it\\'s special... I\\'ve also stolen bites of several other dishes from my fellow diners (friends, not random people), which have also tasted amazing, so I think it\\'s fair to say that you can\\'t go wrong with the menu here (especially the \"Specials\" section).<br/><br/>There\\'s also a wide drink selection, of which the whole young coconut is my favorite - cool, refreshing, and naturally sweet. Plus you can scrape out the juicy fruit insides when you\\'re done! It\\'s super tempting and I usually end up caving and ordering a coconut even though I think is a bit too pricey at $6.50.<br/><br/>Finally, they accept reservations online via Yelp, which is always a plus. Definitely will be back for some amazing Thai food (and to gawk at the huge bathrooms)!</p>',\n",

I don\\'t know, to be quite honest. \\xa0But it\\'s pretty darn tasty and the menu is large and varied enough that I believe there\\'s probably something for everyone. <br/><br/>The restaurant is large by San Francisco standards and it takes reservations, which is a big plus. \\xa0The restaurant has a nice balance between open and clean with rustic charm. \\xa0The nice bar side seating and view od the kitchen gives it a good \"modern\" spin. Parking nearby is also not terrible as they are actual parking not just curbside spots where you hope you fit and aren\\'t sticking into someone\\'s driveway. <br/><br/>The food is tasty as I mentioned before. \\xa0The appetizer that is basically a coconut shrimp lettuce wrap is really good and comes three to an order. \\xa0Although papaya salad is a standard dish, give the rice salad a try. \\xa0The short rib masaman curry is less curry and more of a curry rub fyi, not bad just slightly misleading by the description. <br/><br/>All in all I love this spot. \\xa0It\\'s a good place to take people with varying tastes and the service is always fast.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">It was our first time eating at this Thai restaurant and I must say our experience was wonderful thank u! I ordered the Hat Yai fried chicken it was $16 but it was amazing to me .. The presentation was beautiful.. The interior of the restaurant looks rustic and creative my kinda style! My husband ordered the peppered chicken but he kept eating off my plate it was that good! I just love love the Thai iced tea on that hot day hit the spot! The house soda was also good!!!

I was immediately impressed, but a part of me was a bit wary since experience has told me that fancy Asian restaurants usually has sub-par food.<br/><br/>I am happy to report that, this is not the case at here at all. In fact Farmhouse Kitchen Thai fits the restaurant trifecta that is often so hard to meet in this day and age:<br/><br/>+ Insane Presentation: My barbequed chicken was served spatcocked on bamboo sticks, very much like how I was served in the jungles of Thailand.

Not only is the staff super friendly, super accomodating, and generally super awesome, but the food matched their level of awesomeness and then some.<br/><br/>Farmhouse Kitchen provides upscale Thai food with a twist... as well as all of the classic Thai dishes that you know and love. Want pork belly or tiger prawns in your pad thai? You\\'ve come to the right place!<br/><br/>We all started off our meal with some fresh young coconuts cracked open to reveal the sweet, refreshing coconut water and tender, delicious meat inside. What a way to begin! We also got some appetizers for the table -- the grilled beef and the spring rolls were both insanely good.<br/><br/>I shared entrees with Mike B, and together we got the 24-hour beef noodle soup (the beef was literally fall-off-the-bone tender, as it should be) and the pad kee mao (drunken noodles) with pork belly and prawns. Yup, you read that correctly. It was phenomenal, the spice level was just right (I asked for medium), the new meats were a fun addition, and everything just tasted SO good.<br/><br/>And as if all that wasn\\'t enough, for dessert (and because it was our dear friend and coworker\\'s birthday), they brought out these insane dessert platters filled with all sorts of Thai-inspired dessert delicacies. Mango sticky rice, coconut ice cream, some kind of amazing and magical monkey bread... oh man, my mouth is watering just thinking about it. <br/><br/>Next time I\\'m back in SF, you can bet your sweet bippy that I\\'ll be making a return trip to Farmhouse Kitchen Thai!</p>',\n",

We had reserved reservations for 5:30pm but came early to see if there was any room earlier. We were seated immediately which was good. Their Thai food is honestly mediacore for the price they charge. Beware, the portions are pretty small as well. We got the curry, pad Thai chicken, Papaya salad, and chicken fried rice. Chicken fried rice was flavorless. We had to use ALOT of the powdered red chili to have some flavor. I\\'ve had way better Thai food in hole-in-a wall places where it\\'s inexpensive. So as far as food goes, it\\'s MEH. Nothing special and nothing to rave about.<br/><br/>At one point, my friend tried to ask for help and she said \"excuse me\" to our waiter politely I may add. And he legitly held up his hand rudely in her face without saying anything and walked away. WHAT THE HECK. I\\'ve never seen anyone do that before..Maybe the polite thing to say was \"I\\'ll be right with you\". But he didn\\'t do that. We also still had food on our plate we were finishing up. They continuously asked 2-3 times to take our plates away when we were still eating...Maybe instead say \"is there anything else I can help you with?\" NOT \"are you guys done, can I take this plate?\"..when there\\'s still food on our plate! After they took our plates away, we were still sitting finishing off our beers, and the waiter came to clean the table with our napkin right in front of us while we were still at the table. WHO DOES THAT? Not to mention when the waiter cleaned, she brushed all the food scraps on to my lap! I\\'ve never been to a place that was so rude to their customers. Will definetely not recommend this place to friends and will not be coming back.</p>',\n",

We also got tom kha soup, which was a lot bigger than I had expected. The flavor was really on point. For entrees, we got the 24 hours beef noodle soup and the hat yai chicken. While the beef noodle soup was really tasty, I\\'m not really sure if it\\'s worth the price tag. The hat yai chicken was probably my favorite item. The chicken was perfectly crispy and the curry on the side was so good! Pro tip: save room for dessert!! The Thai Vacation, which is a sticky rice with vanilla ice cream and strips of fresh coconut inside of a fresh coconut was absolutely delicious. I had to use all of my willpower to not order another one!</p>',\n",

After 3 or 4 visits to restaurants that were packed this was a welcome find. It was so nice to just walk in and get seated right away instead of the \"it\\'s an hour wait\" greeting we\\'d been getting.<br/><br/>Which was surprising because Farmhouse is pretty great and would warrant a long wait, for sure. But I won\\'t complain about that!<br/><br/>So yes, we were seated right away and brought over menus. Something of note--it\\'s beer and wine only. I had thought longingly of a delightful tropical cocktail of sorts but alas, there were none except a couple of beer cocktails. Not the end of the world, I just ordered a young coconut (to fulfill my need for something tropical and delightful) and some wine instead. That was just fine and dandy.<br/><br/>The coconut in particular was awesome. That fresh, refreshing coconut water and that delicious coconut flesh was fantastic to snack on.<br/><br/>Speaking of snacking on, we also ordered a couple of appetizers--the vegan spring rolls with peanut sauce and the par dip fresh tuna. Both were awesome.<br/><br/>For my entree I went with the Kai Yang, Som Tum which was half a BBQ chicken marinated in turmeric and coconut milk served with papaya salad, sweet plum sauce and black sweet sticky rice. The chicken was phenomenal. Really really good. I loved every bite of it. The salad actually had a bit of a kick to it and as someone who is a little bit (okay, more than a little bit) of a wimp with heat I had to pace myself. The black sticky rice was interesting. I thought it tasted good but the texture was a bit chewy and dry. It didn\\'t really TASTE dry, so I didn\\'t dislike it, but it wasn\\'t exactly what I was expecting. But I would absolutely get that dish again, if only for the chicken. <br/><br/>The presentation on all items was also really cool. My entree in particular came out with the rice in a bamboo container, chicken on cool roasting skewers, etc. I was overwhelmed in a good way when it was brought out the table. Very impressive. The whole coconut was also an awesome photo opp!<br/><br/>I would most definitely return again, and in fact, I look forward to it!</p>',\n",

Even authentic novelty. <br/><br/>So when we started off our meal with fresh, young coconuts I immediately began my mental retreat.

The panang neua was probably my favorite dish, with just enough heat to be interesting without being overwhelming. The beef was super tender. I also really liked the red curry, but the chicken was really dry. The asparagus had a tasty sauce. The pad see ew was okay, but the beef was pretty dry. We ended up ordering an extra pad see ew with chicken because it wasn\\'t really enough food for four hungry people, and we finished it without any problems. <br/><br/>The restaurant was decorated for the Thai new year events that they had held just the week prior. It made for a really lively and colorful atmosphere, especially because there were a lot of hanging bells.<br/><br/>I would return, but I feel like they can make the proteins a bit more tender (higher heat, cook for a shorter period of time!). Also, compared to Thai places in the South Bay, they are a bit on the pricier side. If I could, I would give them 3.5 stars.</p>',\n",

This is not the only one in the Mission, but having to yell at the person in front of you ruins the appetite. <br/><br/>Waiters also need to be a bit louder because of this but they are polite and silent, which makes it even more difficult to talk to them.<br/><br/>I\\'m tempted to give it a 3 because this is something that is severely lacking in most hip restaurants in this area, but it\\'s not always like this, so it gets a 4.

       "  '<p lang=\"en\">This was my first time having Thai food and it was cocoNUTS.<br/><br/>I\\'m kinda sorta adventurous when it comes to what I put in my mouth. I don\\'t ever really crave Asian food and when I do eat it, it\\'s the very basic Americanized (greasy) shrimp fried rice, egg rolls, spring rolls, lo mein... you get the point. On the East Coast we get the Asian food rejects. We\\'re more about our Italian, soul food and seafood. You could say that I\\'m easily impressed by good Asian food since I\\'m used to the sucky kind. <br/><br/>I was greeted with a coconut filled to the brim with coconut water, topped with an umbrella. Ah, yes. I can get used to that. I actually hate coconut. But that\\'s neither here nor there. It\\'s still cool. I gotta admit, your girl was intimidated by the menu. I had to get my coworkers to interpret what the heck I was reading. I ended up with Thai Fried Rice with seafood added. Yes, it was delicious. No, it was not greasy. It was perfect, actually. Perfectly cooked. Big, fat, juicy scallops and shrimp made this dish shine.</p>',\n",

Although there\\'s usually a wait, the servers have been attentive and friendly, and the food has been yummy and fresh. <br/><br/>I recently visited on a weeknight. There was no wait. Our server was inattentive and the food was bad. The food came out super quickly, but my husband\\'s food was cold and the vegetables in my soup tasted old/rotten. We were in and out of the restaurant in 40 minutes. Hopefully they were just having a bad night, but I was surprised to have such a negative experience at a restaurant I would have called great in the past!</p>',\n",

I *want* to like it--it\\'s like that guy you\\'re dating who is great and sweet but you just don\\'t really feel any chemistry with. I love the way Farmhouse Thai looks--as someone else described, it\\'s a hipster Thai restaurant, and there really aren\\'t many of those. The interior is quirky and gorgeous, and the service is great. The food itself comes in huge portions and is beautifully presented. But I\\'ve come here twice, once for a group dinner and once for lunch, and I didn\\'t really enjoy either meal (I got the Tom Yum Soup the second time, forgot what I ordered the first). The flavors are almost a little too intense, and the food\\'s just too heavy for me.

       "  '<p lang=\"en\">After receiving a hot tip at work about newly opened Farmhouse Kitchen, I quickly made a dinner reservation for four this past Tuesday night. When my colleagues and I arrived, we were smitten with the space right away. It\\'s bright and airy with plenty of wood (tables, floor) and I particularly loved the antique sewing machine that doubles as the hostess stand. <br/><br/>Farmhouse Kitchen is the third restaurant from the folks who started Kitchen Story and Blackwood. Definitely start your meal off with a whole young coconut to drink. As soon as you take a sip you\\'ll feel like you\\'re on vacation at the edge of the Mission! I took the lead in ordering a wide selection of the menu for us four ladies to feast upon. From samosas and satay to Penang curry and papaya salad, we sampled a lot. <br/><br/>The stand out for me was the Hat Yai. This Thai-style fried chicken was mega crispy and juicy and I loved the blue rice, potato curry and roti that accompanied it. <br/><br/>At the conclusion of our main dishes, I couldn\\'t resist ordering the dessert platter. My dining companions groaned, but who doesn\\'t want a bite of every dessert on the menu? If you can only order one, make it the mango and sticky rice. The mangoes are impossibly ripe and pair perfectly with the sweet and salty sticky rice!<br/><br/>I noticed when I paid the bill that all of our dishes had been marked \"mild\". This may be the default but I wish we\\'d been asked when ordering what spice level we preferred. I know I definitely could\\'ve handled a little more heat.<br/><br/>Farmhouse Kitchen definitely has all the Thai staples you\\'re used to, but I like their unique takes on less familiar dishes. This is definitely a restaurant I\\'d return to, and when I do I want to try the 24 hour beef noodle soup!</p>',\n",

The herb salad was good too with blue rice. Very tasty. <br/>For main course we ordered two of the slow cooked braised ribs, the fried chicken, pad see eew, pad thai, beef noodle soup and tom zappp. \\xa0The fried chicken was juicy and came with blue rice, roti and curry sauce for dipping. \\xa0Mix the blue rice in with the curry sauce and you\\'ll be satisfied. \\xa0The pad see eew and pad Thai were also tasty. \\xa0The 24 hour beef is a must try, the meat is so tender and the panang sauce is soooo good. \\xa0I wasn\\'t a fan of the tom zappp. \\xa0I just didn\\'t like the flavor. \\xa0The beef noodle though was awesome! <br/>For dessert we ordered the platter which came with taro/black sticky rice, pudding, coconut ice cream, watermelon, macaroon and other fresh fruits.

It\\'s a giant chunk of fork tender meat on a rib. The curry was spicy but not too hot and also very flavorful.

Anything fried is yummy anyway. <br/><br/>I was not very happy with my Kai Yang, Som Tum for lunch. The menu says the chicken is marinated in turmeric and coconut milk, and I barely tasted it. I had to ask for more dipping sauce (think more tangy vinegary, but sweet sauce) for flavor. The papaya salad is also spicy so I recommend asking for a substitution.

First off, it was incredibly easy to get a reservation for a party of 13 which is rare in the city. The space is pretty large and the ambiance is casual and fun. Our group ordered close to 10 different dishes, but my favorites were the Hat Yai Fried Chicken and Herbal Rice Salad. The fried chicken had the perfect amount of crunch while the meat was still nice and tender. It went perfectly well with the fried roti and curry sauce. The flavors in the dishes were not as bold or robust as some of my other favorite Thai restaurants; however, Farmhouse Kitchen excels in presentation. Each plate is beautifully plated; perfect for all your Snapchats and Instagram photos. Oh if you come for a birthday, they will do a nice little birthday song and dance for you. Our group walked out pretty full and each person paid $36.</p>',\n",

Definitely more on the exotic/fusion side, but it was great for American standards. The atmosphere was slightly more trendy, but not as night-clubby as an Osha Thai. <br/><br/>We ordered the Khan-Toke set and the Hat Yai Fried Chicken. The fried chicken had a different batter -- not buttermilk but more of the fish and chips style batter. The meat was still incredibly juicy though. The yellow curry sauce was great for dipping the roti in. The set was a great way to try a little bit of several different items. The black \\'sticky\\' rice was so sticky that it was actually rather hard and difficult to chew through. I\\'m not sure if that was the intention, but I gave up on it about a quarter of the way through. Other than that, all the other ingredients were very fresh and flavorful.<br/><br/>We also ordered the matcha tea, but they brought out a genmaicha green tea instead. I\\'m not sure if they misheard us or if they ran out of the matcha, but it was still pretty good so we weren\\'t complaining. <br/><br/>Overall, quite a good experience, and we were fortunate enough to visit on NYE to enjoy the Thai performances!</p>',\n",

Two of our 6 were running late due to an Uber fiasco, but the restaurant graciously seated us anyway. <br/><br/>We ordered wine and a few appetizers while we waited, and entrees as soon as they arrived so as not to keep the restaurant waiting too long (the rush started, and a large line had begun forming at the front waiting for tables to open up). <br/><br/>All in all we had too much food, and what was left wasn\\'t really suited to boxing leftovers. We ordered about 4 different appetizers and 5 entrees to share family style. I was probably full after divvying up the first entree, but kept stuffing myself into a food coma. Then there were a few desserts. The ice cream tasted like a basic Dreyer\\'s vanilla, but there was a bread pudding-like dish that basically tasted like the middle of a cinnamon roll.

It was good but the food was not hot, it came out cold to warm. The hubby ordered the chicken wings and crispy calamari. The portion size is a bit small for what you are paying for.

       "  '<p lang=\"en\">TLDR - overpriced, small portions of Americanized Thai food in a nice, trendy restaurant; far from authentic Thai, just okay as Asian fusion<br/><br/>My first time trying Farmhouse Kitchen was through Caviar and thought the food was okay. More recently, I stopped by for dinner. It was pretty busy for late on a Friday night, but it wasn\\'t more than maybe a 10 minute wait for a table for 2.<br/><br/>The restaurant definitely isn\\'t your typical authentic Thai joint. It\\'s nicely decorated and has more of that trendy, Asian fusion vibe. There\\'s table and bar seating as well as a large table that looks like it might normally be used as a communal table if there isn\\'t a large group dining in.<br/><br/>Food overall is just okay. It\\'s definitely Asian fusion/Americanized Thai food, so don\\'t expect anything authentic from here. The portion sizes are pretty small, especially given the prices, but I guess that shouldn\\'t be too unexpected given the ambiance of the place.<br/><br/>We ordered: <br/><br/>-THAI FISH CAKES ($9) - 4/5<br/>[white fish, fresh kaffir lime, red curry paste, sliced long bean; served w/ cucumber peanut relish]<br/>Surprisingly pretty good! Not as good as the fish cakes I had in the streets of Thailand, but I\\'d definitely recommend it. If you\\'ve never had fish cakes before, they\\'re sort of like fish patties with the texture similar to the fish/shrimp balls that you put in hotpot. These had decent flavor and the cucumber relish was refreshing<br/><br/>-MOK SALMON ($18) - 2/5<br/>[grilled salmon in banana leaf, oyster mushroom, lemongrass, dill, shallots, grilled asparagus<br/>spicy cilantro lime sauce; served w/ blue rice]<br/>So disappointing. Definitely miles away from authentic fish amok (which is much creamier), but also disappointing as a salmon dish itself. I love salmon, but this was on the dry side and lacking flavor. I didn\\'t think the cilantro sauce really went with it either. I also don\\'t really understand what the blue rice is. Tastes like normal rice.<br/><br/>-RED CURRY ($13) - 3/5<br/>[bell pepper, bamboo shoots, basil; served w/ jasmine rice]<br/>We got ours with chicken. Pretty average curry. Might\\'ve done better with more heat.<br/><br/>From my prior review/Caviar experience, I got:<br/><br/>-NEUA NUM TOK ($12.10) - 3/5<br/>[grilled marinated flank steak wrapped w/ mint, cilantro &amp; cucumber; served w/ spicy roasted rice sauce]<br/>Looked and sounded much better than executed. It could just be because of the delivery but the steak was a little tough and overcooked. That aside though, I found the flavor to be lacking. It kind of tasted like the amateur Asian steak I\\'m capable of cooking at home. Not sure if it was supposed to be served with a different sauce, but the one that came with mine was some sort of cilantro sauce with a good kick to it, which definitely added some much needed flavor.<br/><br/>-KAI YANG, SOM TUM ($16.10) - 3.5/5<br/>[half BBQ chicken marinated in turmeric &amp; coconut milk; served w/ papaya salad, roasted rice sauce &amp; black sweet sticky rice]<br/>Overall, a pretty tasty dish (and a very decent portion size), but I was more a fan of the som tum (papaya salad) than the kai yang (bbq chicken). The papaya salad had a good balance of salty/savory, acidic and spicy flavors. I would\\'ve liked it even spicier and I remember the papaya salads I had in Thailand being a little sweet as well, but definitely not lacking in flavor. The chicken (one large wing and thigh/drumstick) was tender and fragrant from the coconut milk, but very light in flavor. The rice was whatevers. It wasn\\'t actually sweet and the outside layer got hard pretty quickly. I wish I could\\'ve substituted more papaya salad instead of rice. The rice sauce that came with it was incredibly salty. Definitely didn\\'t need that</p>',\n",

       "  '<p lang=\"en\">I made reservations through yelp but we were running 10 minutes late. I called and let the staff know and they were very courteous and accommodating.<br/><br/>Parking maybe a bit hard to find in Mission, especially on a rainy day like when we went. We were lucky to find free street parking just a few hundred feet away.<br/><br/>We ordered the 24 hour beef noodle soup and fried chicken. 24 hr beef noodle soup was great - the broth had a light taste with hint of lemon grass. You can choose to get it spicy, but we got it mild because of a little one in our group. The meat came off the bones without effort and it was so tender and juicy.<br/><br/>I actually liked the fried chicken dish even more. The batter was crispy and had some flavor to it! It comes with a side of Thai curry and naan bread. Delicious!<br/><br/>To top off our great meal, we ordered the Thai vacation dessert which comes with vanilla ice cream, coconut cream, coconut meat and sticky rice. This combo was out of this world and I\\'m not even a fan of coconut. Since then I\\'ve become a fan of coconut.. especially the meat!<br/><br/>Ambiance is very unique and it\\'s nice decorated inside. A wide open space with wooden tables and thoughtful design touches everywhere. We\\'d love to come back here again.</p>',\n",

       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Picked this restaurant because of the reviews I read on yelp. It was great. There were five of us and we picked five dishes and shared.

       "  '<p lang=\"en\">So far my fav spot in San Francisco! But I\\'m a sucker for Thai food. Love the eclectic/traditional decor, which set the mood for dinner. I came around 6:30 and there was already a 30 min wait for 2. Ended up sitting at the bar, which ended up to be a better experience (in my opinion). The bartender was super accommodating, along with all of the servers who kept on refilling our drinks or taking away plates. <br/>I had the Hat Yai Fried Chicken and it was BOMB. The chicken was so on point, I can\\'t! It had a super crispy and light taste, and with that sweet and sour sauce they served on the side, you have no choice but to shove your face. The potato curry was delicious too but a tad too sweet for my liking. Still, it made for a great sauce for the blue rice. <br/>My boyfriend had the curry chicken and noodle bowl and he said it was amazing. I liked it too. There was just the right amount of heat, and the chicken was tender. <br/>Overall, amazing experience. By the time we were finished dinner, the place was packed. Parking is sort of hard to find, but this is San Fran, so expect that?! Luckily the street parking opened up at 6 so we literally grabbed the last spot close by. <br/>If I\\'m ever in San Fran again, I\\'ll definitely be back!</p>',\n",

I concur with the person who said this is the most hipster Thai place ever. Service was friendly and I had high hopes for the food based on other reviews. <br/><br/>Papaya salad - omg this was spicy as hell and I eat spicy all the time. I have a pretty good tolerance but this was really, really spicy. I can\\'t imagine your average person could eat this. \\xa0The flavors were delicious but I couldn\\'t find the chillies or maybe there were seeds in there I couldn\\'t see so there was no avoiding the spicy. It\\'s the kind of burn you feel in your stomach even. <br/><br/>Tom Yum Noodle soup - ridiculously salty. Inedible! I doubled the liquid quantity with hot water and it finally became barely acceptable. It was inedible and my husband agreed. <br/><br/>Chicken noodle soup - really good <br/><br/>Pad Thai - dry and no flavor<br/><br/>Green curry chicken - wonderful and the blue rice was a fun surprise<br/><br/>I\\'m hoping I hit it on an off night or maybe it was so late they gave me the end of the tom yum soup and all the spices had settled in it. There was more than a half inch of red oil at the top of the container.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">I usually love the food and the prices are understandable if maybe you\\'re eating dinner but for lunch to pay dinner prices is just absurd. Plus the portions are so meager I don\\'t know how they can morally feel okay with that. I know the rent is expensive in San Francisco but $17($21 with tip) for a bowl of noodles(just an example but every entree is over $18 with tip) at lunch is just unjustifiably \\xa0extravagant, guys.<br/><br/>Also to have my dish served incorrectly and then re-served with the correct choice of meat tasting bland and undercooked because the cook just threw it back in the pan and picked out the wrong meat is just bad business.<br/><br/>I hope this place gets it together because the food and atmosphere is great but repeat eat value is low.</p>',\n",

Great authentic flavors and the only restaurant in the US I\\'ve seen that uses river prawns - those gigantic shrimps that almost look like lobsters!

       "  '<p lang=\"en\">I really wanted this place to be good. Before I get into the experience, let me say the food was ok; not spectacular. Certainly not worth everything that came after. Everything else was a disaster. You will not find a parking spot. Catch an Uber if you decide to disregard this review. The place is small and crowded. Horrendously crowded. A friend and I ate on a Wednesday evening and can\\'t imagine what a Friday looks like. We called ahead and the wait for a table was still over an hour for a table for 2. We decided to sit at the tiny bar until a table came available. Finally decided to eat at the bar because we got tired of waiting. And tired of being ignored by wait staff. Eating was a mess of getting jostled and bumped into. The place was cramped. What happened next was half my fault, but the waiter left my credit card at the register when he handed back my receipt. I didn\\'t realize that he didn\\'t give my credit card back until I was in the airport 12 hours later. <br/><br/>Called the restaurant. They did have my card but would not discuss it. Told me a manager would call me back. And happily he did. I asked him to mail the card to me and after a reluctant conversation he agreed to send it. I pay for everything with that card and wouldn\\'t be back in San Francisco for 3 weeks.<br/><br/>He didn\\'t send it. Now I\\'ve gone through the trouble of canceling a widely used card and getting all my accounts reset to a new card I am very unhappy with the total experience.<br/><br/>Needless to say I work in San Francisco a couple of times a month and will never eat here again.<br/><br/>Update. The card came today. Postmarked 2.17.17. You had not sent the card as stated in your response. Photo of the envelope available.</p>',\n",

And this was no different, delicious fried flavor, sauce, and all!<br/><br/>* \\xa0Hat Yai Fried Chicken - Another very tasty and flavorful dish, that suffered a bit because the chicken itself was too dry. If they get to a point where they can consistently keep this juicy, I can easily see this becoming a favorite of mine.<br/><br/>* Neua Yang Steak - Great, great flavor here too, but, like my experience at Cockscomb, our medium rare steak came out more like a rare steak. Remind me to confirm with restaurants what medium and medium rare means to them next time?<br/><br/>* Seafood Fried Rice - I guess from the list of ingredients I shouldn\\'t have been entirely surprised, but this was another somewhat bland dish, especially compared to the crab fried rice at Ler Ros.<br/><br/>* 24 Hours Beef Noodle Soup - A simple dish in appearance, but wholesome and good nonetheless.<br/><br/>Mind you, this is no where near Lers Ros tier deliciousness, but what you lose in flavor, you gain in decor and ambiance: Farmhouse has easier parking, less sketchy surroundings, a more spacey interior, and, perhaps most important, a lower overall volume that allows for easier conversation.<br/><br/>***Accessibility Info***<br/><br/>Venue - Large and spacious, with a good amount of spacing between tables, so accessibility isn\\'t much of an issue.<br/><br/>Bathroom - Accessible!</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Came to this place for lunch on Sunday. I would say the food is alright but alittle too expensive. The total amount per person worked out to approximately $40 with a meal and a non-alcoholic drink. The quality of food is not up to my expectations but the presentation was a 5/5.

The drinks r pretty good though such as honey lavender milk, and the iced coffee.</p>',\n",

       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Mediocre Thai food that\\'s outrageously overpriced. Does every entrée have to be offered as vegetarian or vegan simply so this restaurant can charge you an extra $4 or $6 to add meat. Our meal for 2 people was just shy of $100. The price is too high for calamari that arrived cold and soggy; som tom that was too spicy to eat when it been especially ordered mild; and pad thai that was bland and congealed into a ball. However, the 2 shrimp and 2 rings of calamari that we paid $6 in the pad thai were delicious.

Then, they said it had been delivered already when it hadn\\'t. We never got food. They were rude and unapologetic. Will definitely not ever go here again.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">I\\'ve eaten here twice. Both times I thoroughly enjoyed the food. The reason why I hesitate to give this restaurant a higher review, despite the delicious grub, is due to three reasons- two of which are the result of restaurant stingy-ness. <br/><br/>1- First, upon asking if we could have a bit more of the sauce that came with our appetizer spring rolls, we were informed that they don\\'t give out anything for free. This was a big turn-off especially because this restaurant is above-average priced comparatively speaking to other Thai restaurants. Their higher prices should well encompass offering a small amount of extra sauce. We then asked them for soy sauce instead. 5 minutes later the waitress came out with the tiniest drop of soy sauce in the smallest bowl. Obviously they had a huge issue with providing anything extra at no-cost, even for small items which normally come at no-cost with a meal at a restaurant.<br/> I see this as equivalent to a burger joint charging you extra for ketchup or mustard. A bit ridiculous in our opinion.<br/><br/>2- Second, they don\\'t do anything gratuitous for birthdays. Only if you order a dessert do they come sing you happy birthday which is quite lovely but if and only if you order on your own. Both occasions I ate here was for birthdays and we were too filled from dinner to order dessert so we missed out on the experience. <br/><br/>Third, the restaurant design is quite a lovely open space but because they are packed in the evenings- you have 10-20 people standing at the entrance literally peering over all of the diners seated towards the entrance of the restaurant. This makes for a stressful environment for the entrance-seat diners and as a result you feel obliged to eat faster and enjoy your dinner less. Their space is such that it could easily be fixed with some sort of separator to divide diners from tens of people anxiously waiting to be seated.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">The food was amazing. Try to be on time for your reservations because they wont seat you unless the whole party is present and will give your table away if they are too late. However they do try to accomodate you once the whole party is there. Go on friday nights that is when they walk around the tables selling street food just like in Thailand. It was a great experience. I got to try crickets and silk worms for the first time.</p>',\n",

       "  '<p lang=\"en\">The hat yai fried chicken was sublime. Literally one of the best fried chicken I\\'ve had in the US. Of course, it\\'s a different type of fried chicken from, say, KFC. But still, it was cooked to perfection. It also came with curry and blue rice (and a sweet sauce for the chicken) and each part was absolutely delicious. It\\'s a little pricey ($19 for my meal without tip and tax) but I thought it was absolutely worth it. I recommend anybody who loves Thai food to come here.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">The place very crowded so our expectation \\xa0jumped a notch higher as the review for this place was good. However our food was very oily.

       "  '<p lang=\"en\">It was bookmark Sunday and the frenchman wanted Thai. Since he dislikes going far from home, I remembered this new spot while walking the dogs one afternoon. The location is he artists neighborhood between Mission and Potrero. The area is quiet and the streets are cleaner than Mission and Valencia. It was Sunday so I did not think a reservation would be needed. Do not be fooled folks, this place is secretly popular. It was packed! Even still we waited less than 10 minutes for a table. Though seated we waited more than 10 minutes for a server to come to our table.<br/><br/>Once water was on our table our server came to take our order. I wanted to try the young coconut drink after reading the rave Yelp reviews. Unfortunately they were sold out. In its stead I went with the Thai iced tea and wow!! Just wow! It was perfection. It wasn\\'t too sweet, nor to heavy with cream/milk. It was so refreshing I ordered two back to back! \\xa0<br/><br/>For our meal we ordered the Beef salad and Thai crispy rolls as appetizers. Followed by a<br/>vegetable Tom Yum and Kai Yang Som Tun BBQ chicken as the main course. Let me start by saying everything was so wonderfully delicious. So much so that when we were walking home I was hurting I was so stuffed! I just could stop eating everything. <br/><br/>The beef salad was exceptional! The beef was seared to a juicy tenderness which perfectly complimented the cucumber and scallions. The crispy rolls were just as delicious. Crispy, flaky pastry stuffed with silver noodles, cabbage, mushroom and cilantro. Their house made sweet chili sauce was again, not too sweet and definitely not like the heavy consistency you get with the commercial sauces. \\xa0No red/pink color dye here! I was torn with the Tom Yum. On the one hand the broth was spectacular and the vegetables were al dente. Bit the flavor of the broth was not your normal Tom Yum and it certainly wasn\\'t as spicy as I was hoping. It was good, but I would not order it again if I was in the mood for a traditionalTom Yum. Buy the time our main course arrived we were practically ready to throw in the towel. But when a plate 1/2 the size of the table arrived with our chicken, sticky rice and papaya salad, our stomachs nearly jumped out of our eyes! Juicy, peppery meat that melts in your mouth, only to be refreshed by the accompanying tangy papaya salad. <br/><br/>The service was good, but it was not outstanding. I did not like hat we had to wait so long for someone to come to our table after being seated. Additionally, we ordered quite a bit of food. Everything came all at once; the salad the soup and the rolls. I was surprised that our server didn\\'t consider the size of the 2 person table, which was very small. \\xa0It would have been better to receive one or two items at a time, so we could take our time to enjoy each course. I ended up having to tell him to wait on the chicken entrée. <br/><br/>Overall the meal was very good and it wasn\\'t overpriced. All of the ingredients are organic and fresh. I hope on my next visit they will have the young coconut available.</p>',\n",

Food-wise, this is some of the best Thai food I\\'ve had - full of flavor and SPICE!! Definitely felt the heat, but not so much that I didn\\'t enjoy the meal like some other places I\\'ve been too. We ordered the mango salad, penang curry with tofu, and crab fried rice, which were all delicious. We were also offered some complementary \"street food\" appetizers.<br/><br/>The ambience for dinner was dim but relatively lively and colorful, so good for a fun date or outing with a group of friends. They have small tables that seat 2 or 4 as well as long tables that could hold a large party. <br/><br/>I will DEFINITELY be here again. I want to try everything on the menu!! I recommend making reservations or coming early, as the restaurant really filled up towards 7pm.</p>',\n",

       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Arrived at 5 PM being hungry East coast time. Hostess was kind and ask us to wait till opening. Decor was whimsical throw back Thai farmhouse. Hostess let us sample wine before we bought a bottle. Enjoyed delicious fried chicken, spicy shrimp and drunken noodles. Nice spice and gave us extra spices for extra heat. Great dinner!</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">I wasn\\'t sure what to expect when I came here. \\xa0I mean the name itself is kinda weird. \\xa0When I think Farmhouse, I think stuff like brunch with eggs and bacon, not Thai food. \\xa0But aside from the name, my dining experience here was pretty good!<br/><br/>A modern atmosphere with a touch of Thai decorations to remind you you are here to eat Thai food, not brunch :). \\xa0They started us off with some sweet potato chips that were lightly salted. \\xa0Actually really good, and I don\\'t prefer sweet potato chips.<br/><br/>We ordered the Herbal Salad, 24 hr Beef Noodle Soup, and Hay Yai Fried Chicken. \\xa0The Herbal Salad was good, but not really my thing. \\xa0It had a strong taste of Coconut rice, which is not a bad thing. \\xa0The textures within the salad were varied and come together well, the different flavors were okay together. \\xa0<br/><br/>The Beef noodle came out next, and wow, I was really surprised at how much I enjoyed it. \\xa0The beef was so tender and came bone in! \\xa0It had a very distinct thai twist to normal beef noodle soup, with a hint of boat noodle broth that I really love. \\xa0The noodles themselves were normal egg noodles, but the star here is the soup and beer rib. \\xa0<br/><br/>I wasn\\'t sure what to expect from the Hay Yai Fried Chicken, but it was presented well. \\xa0The fried chicken was heavily battered but flavorful. \\xa0It\\'s greasy enough that I don\\'t know why people would think its dry, especially with the sweet and spicy glaze drizzled over it. \\xa0It came with pieces of Roti to dip in a curry that was really, really flavorful. \\xa0I wasn\\'t sure if it was mean to be put on top of the chicken (with glaze sauce and all), but it was really good. \\xa0Came with blue coconut rice! \\xa0(I was pretty coconut riced out by this point).<br/><br/>Portions were really good sized so we didn\\'t finish what we ordered between two of us. \\xa0Slightly disappointed they didn\\'t include the curry with the take home box for the chicken.<br/><br/>Service was a okay, still need a little tweeking.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Had an excellent meal here!! My friend who is part Thai recommended it and it was honestly one of the best Thai meals I\\'ve ever had. It kind of reminded me of Burmese food too....We had the short rib, green curry with eggplant and tofu, pad Thai, fish cakes, tiger prawn appetizer, steak and their street food special. Everything had great flavor. A little sweet and a little spicy, which was a perfect combo! The green curry was a little watery and not thick like I\\'m used to, but the flavor was still excellent. I\\'d definitely come back!!!<br/><br/>Our reservation was at 7pm and they sat us right at 7, which was great. They did rush us with our meal a little, clearing plates before we were done but I think they were just trying to turn the table since they had a wait. Overall it was still a great experience</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Amazing. The fried chicken is where it\\'s at. We started with the little steak rolls-very flavorful, the sauce on the side was amazing. We had papaya salad which didn\\'t disappoint. The fried chicken was amazing and full of flavor. Very interesting dish with many different flavors and textures. The only thing I was disappointed with was the crab friend rice. Could\\'ve had more flavor. We are OBSESSED with the Thai vacation, so yummy!</p>',\n",

Based on the other positive reviews, I will try to go in person.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Somehow this place managed to have favors that were both comforting, yet stood out as special among the standard dishes that most Thai restaurants have in common. The red curry is a great example--delicious and non-generic. Cute ambience, nice servers.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Whelp. I can\\'t say how the food is because it never arrived. The restaurant was clearly busy when we called for delivery and they said it would be about an hour. Fine. It was longer than that but the driver called to say they were outside and we needed to come down because there was no parking. Not awesome-but OK. (There\\'s always parking) we went down and there was no one there. We called her back she yelled some stuff down the phone said we needed to come down (we were already in the street looking for her) she argued some more and finally we just cancelled the order. 90 minutes and still hungry! Also to call back the restaurant to cancel their line was busy for about5 minutes and then they accidentally hung up on us. So servicewise a pretty big fat fail. Hope your experience is way better. Delivery shouldn\\'t be this haaaaaaard, right?</p>',\n",

       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Farmhouse Kitchen is a new interesting and different Thai restaurant in the Mission. When you walk into the restaurant, you are taken aback by the unique decorations and the variety of different fresh plants around the place. I really enjoyed the vibe of this place - kind of felt like we were in the jungles of Thailand. <br/><br/>On to the food and drinks. I started out with the beer and pineapple juice drink which was super refreshing! There were pieces of fresh pineapple in the drink and it didn\\'t have a strong beer flavor; I\\'d definitely recommend it. For food, we shared the red curry with tofu and the basil tofu dish. The red curry was pretty thick and a little more spicy than I like. I ordered the roti to eat with this dish and it was a good choice because the thick texture of the curry. I enjoyed it but it wasn\\'t your traditional red curry.The basil tofu dish had a LOT of vegetables. They were all really fresh, but I think I would have enjoyed a little more tofu in this dish. I really liked the sauce it was served with and wish there was more of it. <br/><br/>All in all, it was a pretty satisfying meal and I would definitely go here again! This is definitely more upscale than your regular thai restaurant so be ready to pay more for that too!</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Probably the best thai food in San Francisco. I always get the panang curry with beef and it\\'s amazing every time. <br/><br/>However, I would recommend you get take out, not eat in. The music in the restaurant will drive you crazy after a few minutes. It is like a loud thai rave in there and you can hardly have a normal conversation over it. <br/><br/>Will continue to get takeout from here at least once a week but probably not eat in anymore.</p>',\n",

I\\'ll never go here again after that terrible experience.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Terrific place to get some great thai food.

       "  '<p lang=\"en\">It has been a while since I\\'ve written \\xa0a review for any business, and our family\\'s exceptional experience from Farmhouse Kitchen Thai Cuisine prompted this review. Upon arriving we were greeted by a fabulous host(ess) acknowledging our family of three immediately. It was a busy Saturday night, and I unfortunately was unable to book a reservation online, and magically we were ushered to a table. Farmhouse Kitchen\\'s service exceeded expectations; the price point of the food is appropriate; and since we\\'re on the subject of food it was exceptional from the wild salmon wrapped in a banana leaf to the fish cakes and even the brown rice was the best brown rice I\\'ve ever tasted. But what made the whole experience 5-star was the coalesce of perfectly done foods, prompt friendly service, all within the ambiance and stylized form of Thai culture reflected from the servers\\' attire and the occasional server carrying food on a basket with a rod throughout the restaurant floor. No other Thai restaurant from the states come this close that I am aware of. I definitely come again!</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">I will say this about Farmhouse; if you are not a spicy food lover, beware! The dishes here are not for the faint of heart (or tastebud). However, if you enjoy spicy food or love a good challenge in cuisine, this is the place for you. I particularly enjoyed the Papaya Salad and the 24 Hours Beef Noodle Soup. \\xa0If you are looking for the next new Thai place to cross off your list, this is definitely the place to go!</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Super fresh authentic Thai food- and the staff is<br/>Quirky and fun too!<br/><br/>I had the Panang Curry with vegetables and we also ordered the crab fried rice. Small portions but make up for it with taste. We also got the bread pudding dessert and was very full after main course and two appetizers.<br/><br/>Would be a great spot to take out of town visitors!</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Ambiance: Hip and relaxed - with dim lighting, subtle Thai music, lovely decor and wooden tables. <br/><br/>Service: Excellent. Waters were constantly refilled and everyone was nice and friendly.<br/><br/>Food: Delicious! However, it\\'s on the pricier end of the scale for Thai food... but the dishes are not like your typical Thai dishes. They have a fusion-style take on plating and taste - similar to how Kitchen Story or Hash House dishes are like. We got:<br/><br/>Herbal Rice Salad ($12): SO good and a must try. Includes their staple blue jasmine rice, mixed with a myriad of ingredients such as peanuts and green mango. Think something like the Tea Leaf Salad at Burma Superstar.<br/><br/>Fried Chicken ($18): Came with a side of curry, roti bread, and blue rice. The chicken was perfectly fried and juicy! I loved the presentation, with a knife stabbed through the roti bread on the chicken.<br/><br/>Panang Neua (Braised Short Rib) ($22): Very tender and flavorful, a little spicy. This dish is a bit heavier on the spices, and includes a mix of brocolini and veggies topped with their red curry sauce and blue rice. <br/><br/>We loved all our dishes and would come back to try other dishes. It\\'s a nice date spot, with excellent food and good ambiance - nothing too fancy but still upscale enough.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">This was my first time eating at Farmhouse Kitchen and I was really excited. I saw a lot of positive comments &amp; food photos on Yelp so I chose this place for my wife\\'s bday. I also invited a few friends to join us to surprise her. When we got there the place was packed and lively.....maybe just a little too loud but I was ok with it. Our reservations were at 7pm and it did take some time to get seated, 7:35/7:40, so be prepared to wait a little during peak time. When we finally got seated and ordered appetizers/dinner I was very pleased with the service. We ordered the samosas, ahi tuna &amp; grilled beef appetizers. The appetizer servings are very small for the price, since we were a party of 6 I had to double or \\xa0add a 1/2 order to each appetizer, for example 1 x samosa order only included 3 pieces for $9. The samosas were very small, with little filling but the presentation was very nice, the ahi tuna was good but it was very spicy. I was ok with it but others in my party thought it was too spicy. Now the beef roll appetizer was perfect and I would order that as a meal. After appetizers our Tom Kha soup arrived. I was a little disappointed, too much coconut and not enough lemongrass, a big miss for such a basic Thai dish. Then the main dishes arrived. 3 of us ordered the most popular dish Hat Yai fried chicken. Presentation was nice and the dish was pleasantly good, I give this dish a 3.9 Star. The chicken was cooked well but I think the surrounding food such as the roti (a little oily) and curry fell short (not enough curry flavor/bland). My brother-in-law ordered the short ribs and it looked good! I almost wish I had ordered it myself until he commented. It was too spicy and it was burning his mouth. I could tell though the dish was cooked perfectly as the meat was easily pulled off from the bone. And the final order was the bbq chicken. Again, great presentation but I heard that the chicken was a little dry and the side salad was way too spicy.<br/><br/>So, my final thoughts are if you\\'re looking for a cool, hip &amp; trendy restaurant then this is the place. If your palate can\\'t handle the spice let your server know and maybe they can adjust the spice. <br/><br/>For me I\\'m 50/50.....I\\'d probably go again but for lunch. My rating for the food only is 3.85 stars....just missing that 4 by a little and can easily become a 5. The Service though is a solid 4.5 stars.<br/><br/>I hope this helps....enjoy if you go!</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Really cute, modern Thai restaurant on a hidden street in the Mission. I loved the traditional touches of decor in the modern, open space. There was a line when we went, but luckily we were able to snag last minute reservations and were seated early.<br/><br/>FOOD<br/>* Herbal rice salad - SO GOOD. I loved the crunchy texture and herbs in the rice. It was really flavorful, savory and coconut-y all at the same time. The portion was pretty big, and large enough to split between 2 people. Really enjoyed it, and would come back just for this dish.<br/><br/>* Panang Neua - The short rib was really well flavored, spicy and tender. It had a bit of a chew to it, but I still liked it. Good portions for sharing.<br/><br/>* Pad see you - My usual go-to Thai dish. I was a little disappointed in this one, since the other two were so good. The chicken was dry and the noodles were a little mushy, but still tasty.<br/><br/>Service was really great, and our waters were always quickly refilled. Great place for Thai in the Mission, but I think I still prefer Lers Ros.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">As a kid, my family ate Thai nearly every weekend, but never have I had such an amazing experience at a Thai restaurant. This is not your mom\\'s Thai joint.<br/><br/>The decor in this place is remarkable. There\\'s a strange disconnect between the farmhouse/country style decor and the Thai cuisine, but somehow it works. Also, going in the bathroom, you\\'d never guess there was a housing crisis in SF - it\\'s absolutely massive, and there are inexplicably two sinks even though it\\'s a private bathroom.<br/><br/>My friend and I had a heck of a feast when we went. We ordered the samosas, fried chicken, crispy pork fried rice, Thai iced coffees, and the molten chocolate cake for dessert. Everything was superb, but as many other reviewers have pointed out, the Hat Yai fried chicken is to die for, and the iced coffee is the best I\\'ve ever had (like a superior version of the Mint Mojito at Philz).<br/><br/>Overall, this was the best Thai restaurant I\\'ve been to and I can\\'t wait to go back. A++++ 10/10 would buy again, etc.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Came here for a work lunch and the food was not only gorgeous but incredibly tasty.<br/><br/>I would say the only downsides were that it was pretty loud in there, and the service was on the slower side. All but my food came out at the same time and it was slightly awkward having to wait for it.<br/><br/>But that Jasmin rice more than made up for it!</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Fell upon this place as I was Yelping over the weekend for new eats in the city. A block from my old office building. How I miss working in the Mission... :/ The plating alone intrigued me but the reviews were all superb so I was hooked on coming in Monday after work. <br/><br/>Ordered the Hat Yai Fried Chicken. Comes with roti, potato yellow curry and blue rice. This could easily feed two people but I didn\\'t eat lunch so I was able to devour every bite and soak up every bit of the sauce. Couldn\\'t let it go to waste now. :p Every bite of this dish was full of flavor and spice. The fried chicken especially with the sweet dipping sauce and perfectly crisp skin.... Pure deliciousness. Most authentic Thai I have had in SF. <br/><br/>The staff was also super friendly. I also asked the waitress if there was any significance of the 99 faucets on the wall. She explained #9 is good luck within the culture. The faucets resemble the flow of water/rain hence more good luck is brought to you. <br/>Highly recommend and Look forward to trying more dishes.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Out of this world amazing tasty cuisine. Go with friends sample the menu, you won\\'t regret it. Amazing beef and chicken dishes, served with blue smirf lol jasmine rice. Curry sauces to die for.<br/><br/>Staff very friendly and helpful. Place is packed, make sure you take the time to make reservations. <br/><br/>A must if your visiting the city, and if you live in the Bay Area a great reason to come into the city and dine.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">So this review is going to be about my 2 separate visits that took place less than 12 hours apart :P<br/><br/>I\\'ve had this restaurant bookmarked for a while now. First of all, I LOVE Thai food. Secondly, this is a sister restaurant of Kitchen Story. Beside it\\'s location being a wee bit out of the way, I didn\\'t see any reason why I should not pay it a visit. Last night, I finally came here with the BFF for a weekend dinner, AND today again with my mum for lunch. (Mum got a bit jelly and curious when she saw my food posts on a different social media handle. Curse Internet!!)<br/><br/>It\\'s an interesting location for a restaurant. Then again there are a few other cafes in the neighborhood. Gentrification at its best. Parking seems packed both times I was there yet I got lucky and someone pulled out of their places both times. Super cute and trendy decor filled with hippie ambience. Can be a bit loud with the music though.<br/><br/>The service was great both times. During my first visit, we were greeted promptly and led to the bar area since we didn\\'t make reservation and the place was pretty crowded already. During my second visit today, we were seated at a table as the place was pretty empty. I supposed that people would opt for a brunch place with bottomless mimosa instead of Thai food on this gorgeous Sunday. <br/><br/>Now on to the food. Portions are decent and presentation is beautifully Instagram-worthy (when you see two big guys sitting at the next table taking picture of their food, you\\'d know what\\'s up.) During my first visit, the BFF and I tried some of the dishes the lot raved so much about:<br/>*Hat Yai Chicken: The fried chicken breast was crunchy with decent flavor. The curry was flavorful but a bit on the sweet side. The roti, unfortunately, was hard and difficult to chew. We had to put each piece into the curry sauce to \"rehydrate\" them and it would still be difficult to eat. <br/>*24 Hours Beef Noodle Soup: The beef was fall-off-the-bone tender and very flavorful. Regrettably, the broth was awfully salty.<br/>*Ahi Scoops: Warning: super spicy chili sauce sitting right on top of the piece of tuna. I literally sat there for a good minute or two before I regain a little sense of my taste buds. I could barely taste any other flavor from the rest of the dish. Just be sure to have your water ready for it.<br/>The second time around, my mum and I decided to try something different:<br/>*Daily special red curry with (something) prawns in half pineapple: We wanted to try a curry dish and the waitress was recommending it so we thought why not. It wasn\\'t very impressive. Again, the curry was not spicy at all and rather sweet. The two giant prawns were somewhat undercooked and difficult to eat. Love the coconut rice though.<br/>*Pad Thai with Tofu: Decent and solid classic Thai street dish. Yum.<br/>We also tried their *Mango Sticky Rice for dessert. They seemed to have combined black sticky rice with regular sticky rice so the consistency was pretty interesting in a good way. Love the fragrant sesame seeds as well.<br/><br/>Their drinks are pretty interesting too. Besides just the usual Thai Iced Tea that could be found in regular Thai restaurant, they have variety beers, wine, hot drinks and tea as well. Collectively during both visits, we have tried their *Honey Milk Lavender, *Ginger Milk Tea, *Coconut Cream Latte, and *Rogue Hazelnut Brown beer. They were all wonderful. <br/><br/>People might find the price a little higher than other Thai restaurants but I am willing to pay for the wonderful meal, service, and ambience. It\\'s probably good for date night too :P Overall, I enjoy both meals I got there. The one star was taken off because of the overly salty broth and sweet sweet curry. But I will probably go back sometime to try different dishes to see if they might earn that star back.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">I heard good things about Farmhouse Kitchen Thai Cuisine and was super excited to try it out. The atmosphere is great but the food was no where near the 4-star rating that people gave on yelp. I ordered three dishes: Vegan Fresh spring roll (more Vietnamese than Thai), Mieng Kum Kung (Shrimp), and Papaya Salad with Salted Crab. Everything was so salty, especially the papaya salad. The flavor is not authentically Thai. Plus, they served the dishes on possibly the cheapest Thai metal plates available in Thailand. I told the waiter that the papaya salad was super salty. He said it\\'s probably because of the salty crab. If the chef knew salty crab is already very salty, he should have adjusted the salad accordingly. \\xa0They didn\\'t bother to fix it, so that\\'s a knock of their service. Plus the Mieng Kum zesty mixture is also very salty. They served a fried shrimp on it, but the shrimp had no flavor and was way to big to eat with the Mieng Kum the traditional Thai way. \\xa0Lastly, I also ordered sticky rice so that I can eat it with the papaya salad the traditional Thai way, but the sticky rice is dry and hard. I don\\'t think I would recommend anyone to eat here and personally would not return again. Two thumbs down!</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">We ordered the northern Thai chicken special, the pad kee mao and the fried rice. Everything was really really good - the fried rice was phenomenal. All of the flavors were extremely fresh and delightful. I would definitely go back and this place made my list for favorite Thai restaurants. The food came pretty fast too. If you can, uber there or drive there - there\\'s a good amount of parking.<br/>I also recommended the kickboxing bowl for a group!!!</p>',\n",

When you come in, you are greeted by someone who is dressed in a floral button up with some fashionable authentic pants. They also try to capture a little bit of Thai from the up beat Thai music that\\'s circulating throughout the restaurant and in the bathroom. The food was exquisite, especially the Panang Neung! I would definitely go here again, especially if you\\'re celebrating something special because they offer a little surprise for the birthday guest! Overall, it was a pretty great experience with awesome service!</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">What a great find for a team dinner by our fearless leader, Tara! We arrived to fresh coconuts on the table, ready for drinking and eating - absolutely delicious! I will never drink coconut water out of a box again and not want for that fresh coconut instead!<br/><br/>We shared a few apps and I had a bite of the spring rolls and the samosa. Both were great and I would order either one again. For my main course I chose the yellow curry with chicken. I requested it at a medium spice level but there wasn\\'t much, if any, spice and the sweetness of the curry prevailed. It was tasty but maybe a little too sweet for my liking so I might opt for another dish next time. <br/><br/>Service was a bit slow and one of our teammates did not receive her dish for a while after the rest of the group. I think the restaurant is fairly new and they seem to be working out the kinks. I would absolutely go back next time I\\'m in San Francisco!</p>',\n",

I LOVE the atmosphere of your restaurant. \\xa0It\\'s so airy and breezy. \\xa0The Thai flower decor is insanely instagrammable, and we love to use Instagram here in Maryland. #FreeAdvertisingForYou<br/>3. That appetizer with the Waygu flank steak rolled around cucumber and mint in the green curry... well, I was trying to figure out what\\'s been missing in my life for some time now... and it\\'s that. <br/>4. Those spring rolls with the glass noodles. \\xa0I doubted ya there for a second.

I know it\\'s weird, but I love how you serve almost everything on enamel. I love the blue and white enamel plates, I love the red and vanilla colored enamel plates. \\xa0I love enamel- sue me. <br/>8. Everything was so fresh and clean tasting. \\xa0I mean... no heavy oily dishes, the produce was super fresh. The kitchen was clean as a hospital operating room. <br/>9.

Super flavorful and just fall off the bone meat! The noodles were good. They were a bit stuck together but I\\'m guessing it\\'s because the broth was warm and not piping hot(delivered in a plastic container) Still, very, very, very good! It has definitely convinced me to come into the restaurant and try other dishes! The house soda though, didn\\'t do it for me. It seems to be one of those items that you either like not don\\'t like and it didn\\'t hit the right notes for me. Other than that, I\\'m definitely willing to try other items. This is on the list to try in house.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">I really loved this place in terms of ambiance and service. It\\'s so pretty, modern and unexpected, given its location, that it feels like you\\'ve just stumbled accross a secret, cool spot that not many people know about (even though the restaurant will probably be full because it actually seems to be trending).<br/><br/>I also loved the staff, which are cordial, joyful and know a lot about the food they offer. That being said, I gotta tell you I did not love the food itself. And since my friends, who know much more than me about original Thai food, said it is pretty much the real deal, I feel like I have been given fake Thai for a long time. Or maybe my expectations were just too high. All I know is I did not fall in love for my shrimp pad thai, wich I felt was too sweet and a tad boring, or any of the entrances I tasted, like the one that had tiny fried mushrooms stuck together (sorry but I didn\\'t quite memorize the name).<br/><br/>I do have to make one very special mention for their dessert though: we had the pudding with ice cream and it was so incredbly good! Definitely order that next time you come. I\\'d be happy to return and try other dishes - maybe after my upcoming trip to Thailand I\\'ll have an acquired taste for it!</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Can I just say the food was SOOOOOO good. One of the best meals I\\'ve had in a long time. The Hay Tai chicken was so crispy and the meal had the perfect combination of different textures and complimentary flavor. <br/><br/>My friends got the 24 hour beef noodle soup (another thumbs up) and the yellow curry was a hit as well. They also have a wide variety of interesting and fun drinks - the coconut cream latte was the perfect ending note for my sweet tooth. <br/><br/>Prices are well on par with other thai restaurants as well as newish american spots. It was the perfect place for a girls night out in the city.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">I love this place. It is our go-to spot for office lunch. The food is fantastic, and the ambiance is a mix of local modern weirdness and traditional Thai. I suggest a reservation at lunch though as it can get pretty crowded.</p>',\n",

We had a pretty big party and the space was perfect for us. I loved the decor of the restaurant, that faucet wall might be one of the most photographed \\xa0walls soon:)<br/><br/>We started with a couple of appetizers the Thai Crispy Rolls, Neua Num Tok Rolls, and Samosas. My favorite was the Neua Num Tok Rolls the steak was so tender. For dinner it was a Tom Kha soup and yellow curry with beef. Their take on the yellow curry was a little different then what I\\'ve had before. I loved the Roti on top of the curry it was almost like a creamy curry pot pie. The Tom Kha was one of the best I\\'ve ever had with so many fresh veggies and mushrooms I\\'d definitely order it up again. They give you spices to add to your dishes but I do wish they let you order by heat. Dishes were pretty mild overall.<br/><br/>I was so impressed with the presentation of the dishes they were just beautiful. My co-worker ordered the BBQ chicken and it was unbelievable the fried chicken was also an impressive dish. I would definitely revisit Farmhouse again it was so yummy.</p>',\n",

       "  '<p lang=\"en\">First off you should go to this places just to go to the bathroom! Why? because they are pumping in psychedelic pop music from Thailand that rules and you will probably never hear anywhere else! Now we ventured here on a Wednesday night at around 8pm and got in right away by calling ahead. <br/>The place is modern and beautiful, as was the food! They had a great selection of wines and beers from around the world and they were priced right! <br/>I got a beer from Thailand and I ordered some fresh spring rolls with peanut sauce and they were amazing, the whole table enjoyed!<br/>Then for my main course I was wanting something large and in charge, since my lunch was small and I had some serious karaoke to be singing in just a few hours \\xa0so I got the tofu noodle soup. <br/>It was just what the doctor ordered, it was huge, and had an amazing spicy flavor, they even brought me out more spices to try on it! <br/>The service was great, the price was right, and we were in and out in an hour and it was pretty busy in there! This was a destination spot for us and I\\'m glad we took the trip to go here! <br/>One of my fave meals I have had in San Fran!</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Man this place is lovely. I was directed here during their soft opening by a coworker who had a hot tip about Farmhouse\\'s recent opening.<br/><br/>While I\\'m sure this place would be a perfect dinner location, I\\'d actually suggest it for lunch. It\\'s place on Florida is sunny, warm and welcoming. The first thing I got off the menu was the whole young coconut which was fresh and refreshing. It wasn\\'t too sweet, but seemed to perfectly quench my thirst. I noticed they have quite the coffee bar as well, so if you are looking for a midday pick me up this is the place. <br/><br/>We ordered a few dishes, but by far and away the best standout is the Hat Yai. It\\'s a friend chicken dish with a side of blue rice. Additionally, it comes with a wonderfully crispy roit and potato curry. I wasn\\'t totally sure the process of eating the dish (was the curry for the chicken? Was the Roti supposed to be dipped in the curry? Why was the rice blue?) But I ended my meal quite full and content. <br/><br/>Word on the street from some spice fiend friends is that you can really ask them to kick up the spice. That alone is a reason to come back, but having looked at their menu there is a lot more I\\'d love to try.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Get the Hat Yai Fried Chicken. Omg. I moved out of the area and I must say- this is one of the must have items on my list whenever I come back to visit. Probably the best Thai food I\\'ve ever had. Of course I always only get the fried chicken so I\\'m not sure about anything else on the menu. But it is to die for.</p>',\n",

       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Consistently the best Thai food in San Francisco. I have been here over 10 times for lunch and dinner and am always so satisfied.

Definitely recommend coming here for lunch or dinner.</p>',\n",

I\\'ve been to Thailand and I\\'d say this isn\\'t very \"authentic\" street food or anything like that but what they are doing is amazing.

Cool atmosphere too, casual and big space. Good service.</p>',\n",

       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Came here after with the misses on a Thursday night and this place was packed. We did have to wait about 10 minutes for a table but the hostess was very attentive and sweet. When we finally got seated, we ordered samosas (odd for Thai food) and Kai Yang, a chicken dish, to share. I will say the prices are on the steeper side but it is SF and in the heart of hipster land.<br/><br/>Though the presentation and decor were top notch the food was lacking. If I were blindly eating this food, I couldn\\'t even tell you it was Thai, or Southeast Asian for the matter. I am not trying to say the food was bad, it in fact was great, but it just didn\\'t taste remotely Asian/Thai. Very fusion to say the least.<br/><br/>Our meal somewhat ended when my girlfriend took a bite from the papaya salad, and I guess she ate a pepper, which burned her mouth. She could barely speak and had to go to the restroom to soothe her mouth and stomach from the burning sensation, which lasted over 10 minutes. And my girlfriend is one of those people that can handle the spiciness of foods.<br/><br/>Definitely a disappointment for the hype this place gets, but hey if your down for a place to take cool pictures of your food, then check this place out.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Their presentation is amazing! I tried a lot of dishes - fried chicken, Panang Neua (braised short rib), mango sticky rice, bbq chicken, tom yum soup, and beef noodle soup, and thai fried rice with pork belly.<br/><br/>The standout dishes were the braised short rib and the bbq chicken. The short rib was so tender and the meat was falling off the bone. A lot of their dishes come with this interesting blue rice which is pretty delicious. All of their dishes look too pretty to eat. You almost feel bad ruining the dish just to eat it...<br/><br/>I liked that they offered thai fried rice with the option of add ons - add the pork belly, you won\\'t regret it!<br/><br/>Overall, it\\'s a pretty solid thai fusion place. The prices are kind of expensive for the portions but I think you\\'re paying for the presentation, which is worth it in my opinion!</p>',\n",

We tried the Waygu Beef, Hat Yai Curry, the Beef Noodle Soup, and the coconut sticky rice for dessert. And I highly recommend these dishes!

I wish I knew why it was blue as all I kept thinking was I was eating food coloring for no good reason.</p>',\n",

       "  '<p lang=\"en\">I feel like I really have to review this place because I\\'m worried about its location. Its not on any major corners like Flour and Water or Salumeria. It\\'s a little hidden but its definitely near some other really delicious places. <br/><br/>There is not another Thai place close enough around this area. I can\\'t say I know a lot about authentic Thai food although I have had thai food all my life being my mother\\'s favorite. My friends though are and they were quite impressed. <br/><br/>Service: Their service is really good. Everyone is really nice and you can tell they are really trying to do their best. I cannot say that about almost all of the other restaurants around being that this is a very \"hipster\" area. <br/><br/>Atmosphere: I really like the decor. It\\'s defintely hipster in its design so I was a little nervous that the food wasn\\'t going to be very authentic but despite the hip design of the space it was! Glad that authentic asian food can also be met with nice design without overcharging as well. <br/><br/>Food: I had the 24 hour beef soup. That is a lot of food. It comes out with a giant shank of beef. I really apologize for not taking a picture. If you love beef like I do then you should really try it! I also had the tom yum noodle soup which had a lot of flavor. I found it slightly oily though. Their thai tea was a little too sweet for me, I just asked them to add more tea and they did without question. <br/><br/>I really hope word spreads about this place!</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">I\\'ll start from the end: The Dessert Platter is an absolute dream of textures of flavors. The food is playful, delightful and, whichever combination, always provides a feast to the eyes: the Jazmin blue rice contrast beautifully with the might reds of the spicy Ahi Tuna starter, the fantastic braised Lamb and the Great Prawns Pad Thai. Everything is rich and outright delicious, with a zesty level of spice that can be turned up of down depending on your palate. The Crab Fried Rice is delicious, the service is excellent and the ambiance very lively. Great place to celebrate a birthday party.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Never had I have such light yet flavorful thai food. That blue rice was soo good and memorable. Ordered the herbal rice salad, the tom kha, and yellow curry. The herbal rice salad was a great start to open our tastebuds. The soup came shortly after and the lightness of the soup was amazing. Never had I have Thai food and it was so light and fresh! The yellow curry...The least spicy of the 4 types that they had were delicious. The right amount of spiciness for me and it left me wanting to eat the whole thing by myself but we couldn\\'t finish everything because the portion size are very generous. Left with a full belly And more than enough for a delicious dinner too!</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Came here for my birthday with friends and loved it! The place was hard to find at night since it was dark and kind of remote, but good thing there\\'s parking right in front of the restaurant. I got the fried chicken dish with blue rice and it blew me away! Will totally come back again just for the dish. My friends got the special dishes (northern something- It looked like pho noodles), the pad kee mao and ribs- but they all said it was too spicy for them. I recommend asking them to adjust the spice level if you are not used to eating spicy food. Other than that, you must come here for the fried chicken curry with blue rice!</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">After eating here some 40 times, I feel qualified to post a review.<br/><br/>I\\'ll keep it simple: Farmhouse is the best. No hyperbole intended: it is _the_ best. The food is delicious. Every single dish is genuinely inventive. The portions are massive. The price is just right. If you\\'ve got friends from out of town and want to show them the Culinary Delights of the City without showing them the Insane Price of the City, Farmhouse is unequivocally the place. If you\\'re alone and want to chow down at a bar, Farmhouse has you covered. And if you want to grab the best takeout of your life at 9:30pm on a Tuesday, Farmhouse is there for you too. Within 20 minutes you\\'ll be on the couch, in your underwear, stuffing your face with kobe rolls and a soup with a comically large bone-in rib, and you\\'ll feel like a goddamn king.<br/><br/>I cannot praise this place enough: there does not exist a bad item on the menu. And trust me, as a local who eats here 2-4 times a week, I\\'ve exhaustively searched. This is not the sort of joint where you want to order a pound of Pad Kee Mow or Red Duck Curry: aim for the specials and treat yourself to brand new flavors. Personal highlights:<br/>- Panang Neua. Bone-in rib cooked in delicious panang curry, with blue rice and broccolini. I suspect this is their most popular dish, and with good reason: it\\'s phenomenal<br/>- Crab Fried Rice. Everything about this dish is amazing, but the sauce is what really makes it stand out.<br/>- 24 Hour Beef Soup. Zesty, decadent, perfect levels of spice, complete with that signature rib. My go-to comfort meal.<br/>- Mok Salmon. Juicy, perfectly cooked salmon, wrapped in a banana leaf. Sauces are out of this world.<br/>- Fried Chicken. How do they keep perfectly cooking things? Unbelievably juicy, perfect levels of spice, yellow curry dipping sauce.<br/><br/>I could go on. The Neua Steak is fantastic. The Pad Thai is great. My girlfriend claims that if she had to eat one meal for the rest of her life, it would be Farmhouse\\'s Tom Yum Noodle Soup. This place can seriously do no wrong, and while I\\'m greedily sad that it has received so much attention (I remember when you could get a last-minute table on a Friday night), I wish them all the success in the world.</p>',\n",

THAT was real Thai food. I\\'m not saying Farmhouse is not authentic, I\\'m saying it\\'s just not as good. They are trying to be something higher-end than they are by charging an exorbitant amount for simple Thai street food. The ambiance is nice, but you definately do not get what you pay for. We should have known better because no Thai people eat here. Amphawa in Inner Richmond \\xa0is way better. <br/><br/>Kai yang: 5/10 ($16)<br/>Green curry: 7/10 ($16)<br/>Yum moo krob: 6/10 ($12)<br/>Thai coffee: 1/10 thimble-sized ($4.50)</p>',\n",

       "  '<p lang=\"en\">After searching Yelp for a place to celebrate a couple birthdays, I settled upon this place. It got great reviews, the menu had a mix of Thai classics and some new entrees, and the interior looked pretty quirky. Here\\'s a rundown:<br/><br/>Service: From the beginning, we had excellent service. We were running late and had to push our 6:15pm reservation back to 6:30pm -- no problem. Once we arrived (about 5 minutes earlier than our 6:30pm reservation), we were seated immediately. Our waitress was so friendly, attentive, knowledgaeble, and enthusiastic, but not in an annoying way. Our water glasses were never empty and we had several other employees waiting on us, changing out our plates for clean ones, serving our drinks and food, and replacing dropped silverware.<br/><br/>Food: The menu is quite extensive, and like I said, they have Thai classics like Paid Thai and new items like their version of fried chicken! We ordered the Vegan Fresh Rolls, Fried Calamari, and an interesting take on jerky. The fresh rolls were pretty good, but the peanut sauce made it really good. They were well constructed, so they stayed together even when cut in half and the sauce was thick enough to stay on the roll, but not overpowering. The calamari was interesting. Probably my least favorite, but not bad. The batter was unlike any other I typically have on calamari, and reminded me more of the kind you get on fish \\'n chips. The jerky was pretty tasty and definitely reminded me of jerky. For entrees, we ordered the Hat Yai Fried Chicken, Pad Char Shrimps, and Pad Thai. The Hat Yai Fried Chicken was a hit. I wasn\\'t a huge fan of it, because again, the breading reminded me of fish \\'n chips, but everyone else like it. To be honest, the chicken was amazing, and melted your mouth, but it was too greasy for me. It also came with roti, yellow curry, and blue rice, which was tasty. The shrimp dish was just okay - nothing spectacular. The pad thai was really good. Something about it... I couldn\\'t put my finger on it, but it was delicious and the first dish to disappear. There was also a chicken special going on and they offered single serving portions for $7 from a guy wearing one of those sticks across his shoulders to carry things on either side (what\\'s that called?!). Anyways, it was an eye-catching display and got our attention. The chicken was just ok, but you could tell it was authentic.<br/><br/>Drinks: They have an extensive drink menu and you can get whole fresh young coconuts! I\\'m typically not a huge coconut milk person, but it was so good! Between that and all the food, I was stuffed when I walked out.<br/><br/>Price: This is definitely thai food done with quality ingredients (they use Mary\\'s chicken for their chicken dishes!), so expect to pay more, but with four drinks, three appetizers, and five entrees (we asked for two orders of the fried chicken), the total was a little less than $150.<br/><br/>Would I return? Probably. This is a fun find and the food is good. Also, parking isn\\'t too much of an issue.. You just have to look.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">This place is so delicious! My fiancé and I love eating here! My favorite thing to order is the panang curry! It\\'s so delicious, I like it with the roti!

Pairing them up with a few scallion pancakes, curry chicken and blue rice: match made in heaven. Also, you don\\'t have to worry about the bones! Highly recommended!</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">This place is amazing!!!! Authentic, awesome food, not oily, service is great, friendly and fun! Come on a date or bring friends!! Trust me- you won\\'t regret it!!!</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Delicious, clean, and new. Never pretended to be \"authentic\" thai - it\\'s very clear, from the name, decor, and menu, that it\\'s Americanized (ex = fried chicken with curry).<br/>Highly recommend!</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Went there with my wife and two daughters tonight to try it out. \\xa0We went all out and ordered every thing we \\xa0liked from current yelp pictures. Being from Laos I\\'m a bit picky about my thai and lao food. Lets just say I was very impressed with all their dishes. \\xa0The flavors reminded me of home. Everything tasted just right. The girls and I had a wonderful time and will be back again for sure. Its refreshing to see a busy thai restaurant that has excellent and friendly staff. Unlike Osha who is known for crap service. \\xa0The flavors here are more authentic and simple which is what I prefer. \\xa0In regards to price I think it\\'s fair for the quality and care that goes into making it so no complaints from me there. \\xa0Can\\'t wait to go back!</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">It was so cool thai food ever.. Love the design, the test and the food. Green curry and the noodle was super perfect yummmm!</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Delicious food. \\xa0Good to share family style or individually. \\xa0Great ambiance, friendly service and good for groups.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Food was fabulous! We loved the fried chicken and beef brisket. \\xa0Both were unique dishes you won\\'t find at most Thai restaurants. Restaurant had a nice modern open feel. A bit loud. Make a reservation because this place is packed on Friday night!</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Frankly, we discovered farmhouse when we were desperately waiting for a bowl of pasta just like beggars! in front of flour+water, Good riddance, we were asked to wait for an hour and during those desperate moments we took a stroll around the block and BAM! there you go, farmhouse! Lamb chop and fried chicken is phenomenal, it\\'s like go-to food each time i dine here. I am not a fan of their drinks tho, go to next door to tick dog ;)</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Food was really tasty (spicy!). They were a bit too busy for their own good. Took about 20 minutes to get our table open even though we had reservations.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Magically delicious, start to finish. The chicken dishes in particular were amazing. The top Thai restaurant I\\'ve been to outside \\xa0Thailand. And very reasonable for SF, too.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Thai delivery doesn\\'t get much better than this! \\xa0<br/><br/>Got pad see ewe with beef and the green curry, both spicy. \\xa0Honestly, it\\'s Thai food, so you kind of know what you\\'re getting into...noodles were good, beef was fresh and tasty, curry was amazing. \\xa0Rice is blue which is kind of cool, but I have no idea why it\\'s blue. \\xa0The best thai delivery I\\'ve had in the city so far.<br/><br/>Recently ate at House of Thai, and can verify that Farmhouse is significantly better in all metrics.<br/><br/>Awesome take out and even better eating the next day as left overs.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Well, \\xa0don\\'t tell anyone, \\xa0but this place is off the charts good. Excellent food, \\xa0service, venue. Try the calamari, herb rice salad, \\xa0panang curry, \\xa0finishing it off with a coconut latte and mango sticky rice. All exceptionally delicious. And reasonably priced, \\xa0too.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">The food here is pretty expensive as far as Thai food goes typically, but the service was great and the quality of the food was very high. We had a great time and I would definitely come back.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Came in for dinner with my boyfriend as we\\'ve been craving Thai food since we just came back from Thailand (Bangkok and Chiang Mai), but I think we had some regrets in dropping in here.<br/><br/>Overall, staff and decor was great. Super friendly and attentive. And the presentation of the dishes were well thought out.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, we found the flavor to be subpar. We ordered the 24 hr beef noodle soup, pad prik with pork belly, and the neung neur. All the dishes we had relied too heavily on the use of sugar and salt and was lacking in the complexity of spices we were hoping to find.<br/><br/>If you do come here for dinner, be prepared to drink a lot of water as we left rather thirsty. I did enjoy the ginger milk tea (although a bit on the sweeter side too). The drink was very aromatic and they frothed the milk very nicely.<br/><br/>Not sure if we\\'ll stop by again. The prices were pretty steep ($18~ average per entree) for what we got.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">My favorite Thai place as of late and since it opened! \\xa0You can also make a ressie here. \\xa0I recommend the fried chicken, thai crispy rolls, curry and their specials. \\xa0Great service here!</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Fabulous dinner at Farmhouse Kitchen - great food, fun kitsch decor, and cool vibe. The service was a bit slow but worth the wait. I am going home with a happy belly - highly recommended!</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Love the food, decor &amp; service! Must try Hat Yai Fried Chicken &amp; 24 hours Braised Noodle Soup! The fried chicken is moist &amp; not heavily breaded. The beef is fall off the bone. For appetizer - Neua Num Tok Rolls! The beef is deliciously marinated &amp; full of flavor. Try the Ginger Milk Tea, nice kick. \\xa0Thai ice tea too heavy on ice.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Although we were seated about 30 minutes after our reservation, the food was definitely worth the wait. The service was extremely quick and the food was delicious. Special props to the front of house, who managed the people waiting remarkably and was extremely patient and calm with everyone and even gave us complementary sake!</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">We celebrated our friends birthday party last 9/16/2016 it was an amazing experience, all servers are friendly and attentive to our needs. Reasonable price for the service and food we get. The crew will sing a birthday song with their authentic Thai drums that will create loads of attention to the dinners. \\xa0Over all it was a fun night of celebration. \\xa0Just be aware the food portions are small money for the bucks tips are included for large parties.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">This place totally surprised me. Great space and cute decor, food &amp; service was awesome. Everyone loved what they had. The only thing surprising was that it\\'s more along the lines of $$$ and not $$. But we didn\\'t mind it. Will definitely go back again.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Good food , went there twice aleady,, like the atmospheres there, very enjoying and relaxing,, will go there again</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">The staff here was awesome. We were 10 minutes late for our reservation and they still sat us. The food was probably the best thai I\\'ve ever had in SF and I would recommend it to everyone.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Amazingly tasty take on Thai food! Not what you would get in a regular Thai restaurant in terms of menu and price but well worth the trip. Everything we had was a pleasant surprise and this is coming from Singaporeans who have Thai regularly.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">My fellow foodie friend took me to her neighborhood Thai restaurant. It\\'s a family owned place that received a Bib Gourmande this year, its first year of operation. I\\'ve had Thai in the two best Thai food cities in America: Las Vegas and Chicago. This place takes it to a whole new level. I\\'ll be back the next time I\\'m in town!</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">A pleasant departure from the Thai fare at most restaurants. Novel presentation and flavor combinations. Small, chic space in the Mission, offering an amazing Lavender Latte for dessert.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">Really good for takeout. Flavors bold. Generous portions.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p lang=\"en\">We had a very enjoyable and delicious meal. The pad see you was perfect for the kids and even they were pleased. The spicy papaya salad was the best one I have ever had even though it was mouth numbing spicy. It was a very cool and nice environment. Definitely going back.</p>']}"
